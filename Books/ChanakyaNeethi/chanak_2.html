Introduction Chanakya was an epoch-making personality. It was the time when India was emerging out of the ‘Dark Age’. The old values were losing their relevance and the new were yet to be established. It was an age of confusion, which permeated every walk of the society. The Dharma, so far a guiding and uniting force, was being subjected to the contradictory interpretations. The factionalism and fundamentalism were raising their ugly heads and entering into the vitality of the social and religious norms. Taking the advantage of his confusion, Alexander of Macedon invaded India with the help of the selfish rulers of some border states. Chanakya witnessed and felt the severe trauma of this major invasion by a real foreigner. Earlier all the invaders, who attacked us eventually settled in our country itself. But Alexander ’s invasion was an attack of totally an alien culture and army which had strong tradition and strength of their own glorious past. But, ironically, this shattering jolt helped efface the prevailing confusion in India and expedited the emergence of a new system, which was in essence authored by Chanakya. Chanakya was the first thinker of the ancient times who nurtured the sense of nationalism and inculcated in the minds of the people that they owed their basic allegiance to the Rajya (State of Nation) and not to the Dharma. In contradistinction to the earlier concept he made the State paramount. He had seen that in the absence of any omnipotent religious authority the misconstrued faiths were shattering the very structure of society and morality. What was needed the total change or renovation of the system. But, there were no guiding beacons to enlighten the people about this new system. Then he wrote two significant books the ‘Arthashastra’ (known as Kautilya’s Arthashastra) and a collection of his observation on various practical aspects of life entitled ‘Chanakya-Niti’. ‘Chanakya Niti’ is, in fact, this great thinker ’s pithy observation to impart the practical wisdom to the people of his time. But these teachings are so fundamental that it’s relevance is almost ever lasting. Enshrined in the simple sense. Written in simple lucid language with clear thoughts, these observations have not only withstood the test of time but many of phrases, like and have become the oft-quoted proverbs of our attempt has been to bring out their full meaning and interpret them in the context of the modern times so that their undecaying relevance may be fully appreciated. To bring home the fundamentality of these sayings, we have also compared them with the prevailing modern concept. The need for these rather lengthy explanations was felt owing to the occasional terseness of these observations. Sometimes Chanakya even contradicts his own, earlier observations, perhaps to reveal the fundamental truth by sheer contradiction. At times even some of the immoral teachings are the part of this book. But they appear immoral only at the prima facie viewing. While telling what we should learn from the other beings, Chanakya says: प्र यु थानं च यु ं च संविभाग च ब धु षु Prattutthaanam cha Yuddham cha Samvibhaagashcha Bandhushu i.e., “Learn from the cock the following four things: getting up at the right time, fighting bitterly, making your brothers flee and usurping their share also!” Although apparently it appears down right immoral, this teaching is rooted in the instinct of self preservation which is natural. It is in this context that some of such unethical teachings are to be understood.<br />
<br />
Although Chanakya is painted as a scheming manipulator who could stoop to even the meanest level to serve his purpose, a few of his shlokas negate this concept and present Chanakya as a sort hearted and imaginative poet. He says: ब नािन खल सि त बहुतिन प्रेम र जु कृत ब नम यत्। दा भे द िनपु णोऽिप षडं िध्र िनि क् रयो भवित पंकज कोशे ।। Bandhanaani Khal Santi Bahuni Prem Rajju Krit Bandhanmannyat Daarubhed Nipunoapi Shadanghri Nishkriyo Bhavati Pankaj Koshe. Meaning, “there are many bondages but that of love is entirely different. The black-bee, which penetrates through even wood, gets inertly enclosed in the fold of the lotus flowers.” Who can consider the author of this Shlok to be a hard hearted man? There might be certain aphorisms which might appear objectionable to some persons, especially those who discuss the role of women in our society. Chanakya shares the same thoughts as these were prevalent during this time or are still prevalent in certain sections of our society. The entire Hindu thought gives only two positions to women: either they are adorable or they are like any other pleasure source to enjoy. The sense of companionship, which is clearly an occidental concept, is missing for obvious reasons. Well, nobody can be perfect in the world. Even the greatest thinkers of the world had some kind of Achilles heel. A man is a product of the social set up. No doubt, Chanakya tried to affect a change but even he could not get rid himself of some diehard idiosyncrasies. Notwithstanding these minor short comings, Chanakya’s teachings have great sense. One can say this not only from the textural importance of this collection but also from the end result of such teachings. Chanakya believed not only imparting instructions but also seeing their practical implementation. History records that Chanakya not only carved out a massive empire for his pet disciple Chandragupta but also created such an awareness in the general masses that they began to talk about a ‘Rashtra’ or a ‘Nation’ instead of a ‘State’ or a ‘Rajya’. And what could be a greater proof of the soled result of Chanakya’s teaching than for a coming full millennium. No major invasion was undertaken towards the Indian borders. And the social, civil and political norms that he established had the concept of democracy in its embryonic form. Chanakya is one of those few great persons whose greatness enhances with the passage of time. The text used in the book is taken from the standard text first published in Poona in the last century. Although every effort is made to cross-check any interpolation in it, looking to the antiquity of this treatise, there could be some still creping into it. In this collection, we have culled only those aphorisms which give a fundamental or universal message. Lastly, the translator conveys his deep gratitude to Mr. Narendra Kumar of the Diamond Pocket Books for giving him an opportunity to study and translate these pearls of wisdom. – B.K. Chaturvedi<br />

<br />
The Individual (The basic purpose of Chanakya-Niti is to impart knowledge on every practical aspect of life. And in this context, he has touched upon various factors dealing with faith and culture, from the individual’s point of view.) Riches, vitality, life, body–all are fickle and fey; only Dharma is constant and everlasting. * God’s abode is not the idols of wood, stone or earth. He dwells only in feeling. * But, even if one puts one’s faith in the idols of gods made of metal, wood or stone and worships them with total devotion, one is awarded with the desired result. * Anger is death, Lust is (the river of hell) Vaitarani, Knowledge is the cow of plenty and Satisfaction is (the divine orchard) Nandanvan.<br />

Prayer प्रण य िशरसा िव णु ं त्रौलो यािधपितं प्रभुम।् नाना शा त्रे तं व ये राजनीित समु चयम्।। 1 ।। Pranammya Shirsaa Vishnum Trailokyaadhipatim Prabhum. Naanaa Shaastroddhrootam Vikshye Rajneeti Samuchchyam. I salute to the Lord of the three realms, Lord Vishnu, and now commence to describe the principles of the statecraft culled from various ancient books of knowledge. धमत परता मुखे मधुरता दाने समु साहता िमत्रोऽव चकता गुरौ िवनयता िचते ऽिप ग भरता। आचरे शु िचता गु णे िरसकता शा त्रोषु िव ातृ ता पे सु दरता िशवे भनता वयि त भो राघव।। 2 ।। Dharme Tattpartaa Mukhe Madhurtaa Daane Samuttsaahataa Mittreavanchakataa Guru Vinyataa Chitteapi Gambheerataa. Aachaare Shuchitaa Gune Rasiktaa Shaastreshu Vigyataa Roope Sundartaa Shive Bhajantaa Tvayasti Bho Raaghav. Devotion in faith, sweetness in voice, alacrity in alms-giving, guilelessness in relation with friends, humility for the Guru, depth in character; piety in behaviour, regard for merit, erudition in scriptural knowledge, beauty in appearance and belief in Lord Shiva (or in the welfare of all) are, O Raghav (Lord Rama), your attributes!<br />
<br />
का ठं क पत : सुमे रचलि च तामिण: प्र तर: सूय तीव्रकर: शिश: यक िनरवािरिध:। कामो न टतनु बिलिदितसु तो िन य पशु : कामगो: नै ता ते तुलयािम भो रघपते क योपभा दीयते ।। 3 ।। Kaashtham Kalpataruh Sumerurachalashinintaamanih Prashtarah Soonyasteevrakarah Shashih Kshayakarah Kshaarohi Nirvaaridhih. Kaamo Nashtatanurbalirditishuto Nittya Prashuh Kaamagoh Naittaaste Tulayaami Bho Raghupate Kassyopabhaa Deeyate. Kalpataru (The divine tree fulfilling all desires) is wooden: the Sumeru is a hill, the philosopher ’s stone is but a stone; the sun has scorching rays, the moon is waxing and waining, the sea ( water) is saline, the Kamadeva (the god of love) is bodyless; Bali is a demon, the cow of plenty is an animal--O Ram! I fail to compare you with anyone (i.e., everything with best of the attributes have some inherent defect in it): You are incomparable. का िच ता मम जीवने यिद हिरिव व भ्रो गीयते नो चे दभकजीवनाथ जनी त यं कुथं िन:सरे त्। इ यालो य मु हुमहुयदु पते ल मीपते केवलं व पादा बुजसे वनेन सततं कालो मया नीयते ।। 4 ।। Kaa chintaa Mam Jeevane Yadi Harirvishvambharo geeyate No chedarbhakjeevanaarth Jananeestannyam Kutham Nihsaret. Ittyaalochaya Muhurmuhuryadu Pate Laxmipate Kevalam Tvattapaadaambujsevanen Satatam Kaalo Mayaa Neeyate. Why should I worry for life as Lord Hari is the sustainer of the world. Had it not been so then how come a mother ’s breasts be filled with milk for her infant automatically? Believing this (that he who creates life also provides for its sustenance) O spouse of Lakshmi! I pass my life devoted to your feet!<br />
<br />
God पु पे ग ध्र ितले तैलं का ठे विहर् : पयोघृ तम्। इ ो गु ड़ं तथादे हे प या मानं िववे कत:।। 5 ।। Pushpe Gandham Tile Tailam Kaashthe Vahannih Payoghritam. Ikshau Gudam Tathaa Dehe Pashyaattmanam Vivekatah. God dwells in our bodies, life fragrance in flowers, oil in oil seeds, fire in wood, ghee in milk, jaggery in the sugarcane. The wise should understand this. न दे वो िव ते का ठे न पाषाणे न मृ मये । भावे ही िव ते दे व त माद भावो ही कारणाम् ।। 6।। Na Devo Viddyate Kaashthe Na Paashaane Na Mrinnyamaye. Bhave Hee Viddyate Devastsmaad Bhaavo Hee Kaaranam. God doesn’t dwell in the wooden, stony or earthen idols. His abode is in our feelings, our thoughts.<br />
<br />
[It is only through the feeling that we deem God existing in these idols.] अि नहोत्रां िबना वे दा: न च दानं िबना िक् रया। न भावे न िबना िसद्िध त माद् भावो ही कारणम् ।। 7 ।। Agnihottram Binaa Vedaah Na cha Daanam Bina Kriyaa. Na Bhaaven Bina Siddhistasmaad Bhaavo Hee Kaaranam. Studying the Vedas without maintaining the sacred fire and offering oblation to it is as useless as performing the sacrifice without giving alms. One must attempt with feeling of total devotion to get success in any venture. का ठपाषाणं धतूनां कृ वा भावे न से वनम्। श्र या च तथा िसद्िध त य िव णो: प्रसादत:।। 8 ।। Kaashthapaashaanam Dhaatunaam Krittvaa Bhaaven Sevanam. Shraddhayaa Cha Tathaa Siddhistasya Vishnoh Prasasadatah. If one worships even the wooden, stony or the metallic idols with feeling, then by the grace of God one gets the desired objects or adeptness. अि नदवों द्िवजातीनां मनीिषणं िदं दै वतम्। प्रितमा व पबु ीनां सवत्रा समदिशन: ।। 9 ।। Agnirdevo Dvijaatinaam Maneeshinaam Hridim Daivatam. Pratimaa Svalpabhuddheenaam Sarvatra Samadarshinah. The deity of the Twice-born(brahmans) is fire. The wise behold their deity inside their hearts. Those with lesser intelligence deem deity existing in the idols and those viewing the world impartially behold their deity permeating the whole world. कलौ दशसह त्रािण हिर तयजित मे िदनीम्। तदद्धे जावी तोयं तदद्धे ग्रामदे वता।। 10 ।। Kalan Dashasahastraani Haristasyajati Modineem. Tadaddardhe Jaahavee Toyam Tadaadaardhe Graamdevataa. Lord Hari (vishnu) leaves the earth after completing ten thousand years of the Kaliyuga: the Ganga withdraws her waters after comple ting half of this period [i.e., five thousand years of the Kaliyuga [and the Gramdevtas (local deities) leave the earth after completing half of this period (i.e., two thousand five hundred years of the Kaliyuga.)<br />
<br />
Dharm चला ल मी चला: प्राणा चले जीिवतमिनदरे । चलाचले च संसारे धम एको िह िन चल: ।। 11 ।। Chalaa Laxmishchalaah Praanaashchale Jeevitmandire. Chalaachale cha Sansaare Dharma Eko Hi Nishchalah.<br />
<br />
All riches, vitality, life and body are fickle and fey: Only the Dharma is constant and everlasting. अिन यािन शरीरािण िवभवो नै व शा वत:। िन यं सि निहतो मृ यु : कत यो धमसंगर् ह: ।। 12 ।। Anittyaani Shareeraani Vibhvo Naiv Saashvatah. Nittyam Sannihito Mrittuh Kartavyo Dharmasangrah. Constantly bounded by death, all power and pelf are fey. Hence one should adhere to one’s Dharma, which is everlasting. जीव तं मृ तव म ये दे हनं धमविजतम्। मृ तो धमणसंयु तो दीघजीवी न संशय: ।। 13 ।। Jeevantam Mritvannamannye Dehinam Dharmavarjitam Mrito Dharmen Sanyuto Deerghajeevee Na Sanshayah. I deem as dead a being devoid of Dharma! He who adheres to one’s Dharma is long-aged even if he is dead – there is no doubt about it!<br />
<br />
Consequence of an Action यथा धे नु सह त्रोषु व सो ग छित मातरम्। तथा य च कृतं कम कतारम नु ग छित।। 14 ।। Yathaa Dhenu Sahastreshu Vattso Gachhati Maatram. Tathaa Yachcha Kritam Karma Kartaaramanugachchati. Like a calf finds the mother-cow even it there be thousands of cows, so the consequence of an action searches its doer unerringly [i.e., one can’t escape the consequence of an action do whatever one may.] वयं कम करो या मा वंय त पफलम नु ते। वयं भ्रमित संसारे वंय त माद्िवमु चते ।। 15 ।। Svayam Karma Karottyaattamaa Svayam Tattphalamashnute Svayam Bhramati Sansaare Svayam Tasmaaddvimuchchayate. Man himself does action and himself bears its consequences. He himself roams about in the world and gets liberated from this cycle of birth and death [Chanakya says that man is free to act but he must bear its consequences, whether good or bad. It is only his balance-sheet of the action and its consequence has been set at naught that he becomes liberated. Hence to achieve this liberation is also well within the control of man.] कमायतं फलं पुसां वु दि् ध: कमा्रनुसािरणी। तथािप सु ि याचाय: सु िवचायव कुवते ।। 16 ।। Karmaayattam Phalam Pusaani Buddhih Karmaanusaarini.<br />
<br />
Tathapi Sudhiyaachaaryaah Suvichaaryava Kurvate. Although man reaps as he sows and his wisdom is also controlled by his action, yet the prudent and wisemen act very thoughtfully, fully weighing the good and bad consequences. [It means that though the resultant of the deeds committed in previous life decide the good and bad consequence in this life, still one must act after a thoughtful deliberation. आ मापरा वृ य पफला ये तािन दे िहनाम्। दािरद्रयरोग दु :खािन ब न यसनानिन च ।। 17 ।। Aattmaaparaadhavrikshasya Phalaanyetaani Dehinaam. Daaridrayarogah Duhkhaani Bandhanvuasnaani cha. Poverty, disease, grief, bondage and all the infatuative addictions are the fruits of the tree of sin of a person. ज मज मिन चा य तंदानमययन तप:। ते नैवा यासयोन दे ही वा य यते ।। 18 ।। Janmajanmani Chaabhyastam Daanmaddhyayan Taphah. Tenaivaabhyaasyagen Dehi Vaabhyaste. It is after the constant practice of many lives that man attains to the capacity to learn, to do penance or to dole out alms.<br />
<br />
Luck or Fate आयु : कम िवतच िव ा िन नमे व च पचतािन िह सृ य ते गभ थ यै व दे िहन: ।। 19 ।। Aayuh Karma Vittancha Viddyaa Nidhanmeva cha. Panchtaani Hi Srijjyante Garbhasthasyaiv Dehinah. Age, profession, financial status, level of education and death – these five basic parameters of human life are ordained when the being is in the embryonic form. रंक करोित राजानं राजानं रंकमे व च। धिननं िनधनचै व िनधन धिननं िविध:।। 20 ।। Ranka Karoti Raajaanam Rajaanam Rankmev Cha. Dhaninam Nirdhanam Chaiv Nirdhanam Dhaninam vidhih. It is one’s fate that makes a beggar a king or a king a beggar; a rich man a pauper or a pauper rich. पत्रां नै व यवा करीरिवट पे दोषो वस त य िकं नोलूको यवलोकयते यिद िदवा सूय य िकं दूषणाम? वषा नै व पतित चातकमुखे मेघ य िक दूषणाम् य पूव िविधना ललाट िलिखतं त मािजतु क: म:? ।। 21 ।।<br />
<br />
Patram Naiv Yava Karreravit Pe dosho Vasantasya kim Nollokaappyavalokayate Yadi Diva Sooryasya Kim Dooshanam? Varshaa naiv Patati Chaatakmukhe Meghasya Kim Dooshanam. Yattpoorva Vidhinaa Lalaat Likhitam Tanmanaarjitu Kah Kshamah? If leaves do not sprout in the Kareel (Capparis ahpylla ) tree, is it the flaw of the Spring Season? If an owl fails to see in daylight, is it the flaw of the sun ? If the rain- drop doesn’t fall in the mouth of Chatak (Cuculus melanoleucus) is it the flaw of the clouds? Who can alter the fate ordained as the destiny? [Chanakya says that individual deficiency is caused by destiny for which external a circumstances cannot be held responsible.] ईिप्सतं मनस: सव क य स प ते सुखम्। दै वायतं यत: सव त मात् स तोषमाश्रये त् ।। 22 ।। Eepsitam Mansah Sarva Kasya Sampaddyate Sukham. Daivaayattam Yatah Sarva Tasmaat Santoshmaashrayet. Who gets all that one aspires for? Everything one gets is what is destined for one. Hence all must seek satisfaction in whatever they receive.<br />
<br />
Self-welfare याव व थो ायं दे ह: ताव मृ यु च दूरत:। तावदा मिहतं कुयात् प्राणा त िकं किर यित।। 23 ।। Yaavattsvastho Yahayam Dehah Taavanmriuttushcha Dooratah. Taavdaattmahitam Kuryaat Praanante Kim Karishyati. Death is away till one’s body is healthy. Hence one should achieve one’s welfare till one is healthy, for death ceases all activities.<br />
<br />
Self-knowledge नाि त काम समो यािधनािस्त मोहसमो िरपु :। नाि त कोप समो विहर् : नाि त ाना पर सुखम्।। 24 ।। Naasti Kaam Samo Vyaadhirnaasti Mohasamo Ripuh. Naasti Kop Samo Vahinnih Naasti Gyaanaattparam Sulkham. No disease is more deadly than (the sexual) desire, no enemy is more dangerous than infatuation, no fire is hotter than the fire of wrath and no happiness is better than the self-knowledge.<br />
<br />
Truth स ये न धयते पृ वी स ये न तपते रिव:। स ये न वाित वायु च सवस ये प्रिति ठतम्।। 25 ।।<br />
<br />
Sattyen Dhaaryate Prithvee Sttyen Tapate Ravi Sattyen Vaati Vaayushcha Sarvam Sattye Prathishthitam. Truth stabilises the world, makes the sun shine and the wind blow. Truth establishes well everything in life. [Chanakya says that truth alone establishes the order in the Creation.]<br />
<br />
Destiny तादृशी जायते बु दि् ध यवसायोऽिप तादृश:। सहाया तादृशा: एव यादृशी भिवत यता ।।। 26 ।। Taadrishee Jaayte Buddhivaryavsaayoapi Taadrishah. Sahaayaasstaadrishaah Eva Yaadrishee Bhavitavyataa. One gets everything according to ‘one’s destiny. One’s action, response, reaction–all are guided by the factors of destiny. [meaning the rule of destiny is supreme in human life. If one is destined to reap a good harvest one would get situation conductive to his receiving good result and vice versa.]<br />
<br />
Moksha (Liberation) मु ि तिम छिस चे त िवषयान् िवषवत् यज। माजवदयाशैचं स यं पीयूषवत् िपब ।। 27 ।। Muktimichasi Cheetat Vishayaan Vishvat Tyaji. Kshamaarjvadyaashaucham Sattyam Peeyooshvat Pib. O dear, if you really seek liberation of your soul then shun all the sensual attractions as though they are poison and cultivate the spirit of forgiveness, the rectitude of conduct, compassion, piety truth and similar other qualities which are nectar for human life. ब नाय िवषयासंग: मु क यै िनिवषयं मन:। मनएवं मनु याणां कारणं ब मो यों:।। 28 ।। Bandhanaaya Vishyaasangah Muktayai Nirvishyam Manah. Man Eva Manusshyaanaam Kaaranam Bandmokshyoh. Bondage is indulgence in vices and renunciation of them is liberation. Thus it is mind, which drives one to bondage or to liberation.<br />
<br />
Samadhi (Meditation) दे हािभमानगिलते ानेन परमा मन:। यत्रा-यत्रा मनो याित तत्रा-तत्रा समा य:।। 29 ।। Dehaabhimaangalite Gyaanen Paramaattmanah. Yatra-Yatro Mano Yaati Tatra-Tatra Samaadhayah.<br />
<br />
The communion with, and realisation of God, melts away the arrogance of the physical attributes. Achieving this stage, one is able to concentrate easily in meditation, wherever and whenever one wants.<br />
<br />
Vairagya (Aversion to the Temporal World) धमा याने मशाने च रोिगणां या मितभवे त।् सा सवदै व ित ठे चे त ् को न मु ये त ब नात्।। 30 ।। Dharmakkhyaane Shmashaane Cha Roginaam Yaa Matirbhavet. Saa Sarvadaiv Thishttbechchet Ko Na Muchyate Bandhanaat. One develops a version to the temporal world by listening to the sacred tales, viewing the diseased persons and visiting the crematorium. And if one remains averse to wordly considerations, he is bound to be free from all the bondages.<br />
<br />
Soul पु पे ग ध्ं ितले तैल का ठे विहर् : पयोघृ तम्। इ ौ गु ड़ं तथा दे हे प या मानं िववे कत: ।। 31 ।। Pushpe Gandham Tile Tail Kaashthe VAhinah Payoghritam. Ekshau Gudam Tathaa Dehe Pasyaatmaanam Vivektah. Discern soul in the body like you feel fragrance in flower, oil in the oilseed. fire in wood, ghee in milk and jaggery in sugarcanes.<br />
<br />
Quietude य तु संव सरं पूण िन यं मौनेन भु जते । यु गकोिटसह त्रा तु वगलोके महीयते ।। 32 ।। Yastu Samvattsaram Poorna Nittyam Maunen Bhunjate. Yugkotisahastrantu Svargaloke Meheeyate. He, who eats his meals qui etly throughout the year, earns the merit, deserve his stay for thousands of epochs in the heaven. यद् दूरं यद् दुरारायं य च दूरे यवि थतम्। त सव तपसा सायं तपो िह दुरितक् रमम्।। 33 ।। Yaddooram Yadduraaraaddhyam Yachcha Doore Vyavasthitam. Tattsarva Tapasaa Saaddhyam Tapo hi Duratikramam. Even if the destination or the desired object be far away or difficult to achieve one can reach it or get it if one is determined. Nothing is impossible for a determined person.<br />
<br />
Restraint इि द्रयािण च संय य बक वत् पि डतो नर:। दे शकाल बलं ा वा सवकायािण सा ये त् ।। 34 ।। Indrayaani Cha Samyamya Bak vat Pandito Narah. Deshkaal balam Gyattva Sarvakaaryaani Saadhyet. The wise man should put restraint on his sensual desires to control them and then only he should accomplish his work after assessing his strength in the context of time and space [i.e., after cutting off the distraction caused by the sensual deviations, the wise man should enhance his strength to the hilt and then he should assess his position vis-a-vis the place and time he has to accompish his work in.]<br />
<br />
The Only Way यदी छिस वशीकतु जगदे केनकमणा। परापवादशा त्रो यो गां चर तीं िनवरय।। 35 ।। Yaddeechachasi Vasheekartu Jagadeken Karmana. Paraapavaadashaastreebhyo Gaam Charanteem Nivaarya. If you want to overpower the entire world merely by just one action, then put restraint upon your tongue speaking ill of others.<br />
<br />
Who’s Who क् रोधो वै व वतो राजा तृ णा वै तरणी नदी। िव ा कामदुघा धे नु: संतोषो न दनं वनम् ।। 36 ।। Krodho Vaivasvato Raajaa Trishnaa Vaitarnee Nadee. Viddyaa Kaamdudhaadhenuh Santosho Nandanam Vanam. Anger is death (i.e., lord of death Yamraj Vaivaswat), lust is (the river of hell) Vaitarani, knowledge is the cow of plenty and satisfaction is (the divine orchard) Nandanvan. शाि ततु यं तपो नाि त त सनतोषा परं सुखम्। न तृ णया परो यािधन च धमो दयापर: ।। 37 ।। Shaantitullyam Tapo Naasti Na Santoshaatparamsukham. Na Trishnayaaparo Vyaadhirnacha Dharmo Dayaaparah. No penance is greater than the one done for maintaining peace, no happiness is better than the one received from satisfaction, no disease is more damaging than greed and no Dharma is better than the one having compassion for all. य य िचतं द्रवीभूतं कृपया सवज तु षु। त य ानेने मो े ण िकं जटा भ मले पनै : ।। 38 ।।<br />
<br />
Yasya Chittam Draveebhootam Kripayaa Sarvajantushu. Tasya Gyanen Mokshena Kim Jataa Bhasmalepanaih. He, whose heart is full of compassion for all beings, does not need to seek any other knowledge, or Moksha (liberation) or care for rubbing ash all over his body (like the celebrated hermits).<br />
<br />
Alms-giving and Donation दे यं भो यधनं सु कृितिभनो संचय त य वै , श्रीकण य बले च िवक् रमपतेर िप कीित ि थता। अ मकं मधुदानयोगरिहतं न ट िचरा संिचत: िनवाणािदित न टपादयु गलं घष यमी मि का: ।। 39 ।। Deyam Bhojyadhanam Sukritibhirno Sanchayastasya Vai. Shri Karnassya Baleshcha Vikrampatreddyapi Keerti Sthitaa. Asmaakam Madhudaanyogarahitam Nashtam Chiraatsanchitaah Nirvaanaaditi Nashtapaadyugalam Gharshttyamee Makshikaah. All great men should donate eatables and wealth. It is improper to hoard these things. The fame of Karna (of Mahabharat) and Bali (a mythological monarch renowned for his sacrifice and charity) is still unblemished because of their acts of charity. The honeybees ruefully rub their feet against ground. They neither enjoy their honey nor gifting it to others. [Chanakya uses an allegory to bring home his point. He says the honeybees do not eat the honey, they neither collect nor give it to others. And when a person takes away their honey they fall to the ground in utter frustration.] आतषु िवप्रेशु दयाि व चे छ े न य: व पमु पैित दानम्। अन तपारं समु पैित दानं य ीयते त न लभे द ् द्िवजे य: ।। 40 ।। Aarteshu Vipreshu Dayaannivihschechaddhena Yaha Svalpamupaiti Daanam. Anantparam Samupaiti Daanam Yaddeeyate Tanna Labhed Dvijebhyah. He who gives gifts and donations to the distressed and the learned gets back his these gifts many times over [i.e., they earn great merit by these gifts because by helping - them they not only preserve life knowledge but also help in their growth.]<br />
<br />
Gift to the Deserving ीय ते सवदानािन य होमबिल िक् रया:। न ीयते पात्रादानमभयं सवदे िहनाम् ।। 41 ।। Ksheeyante Sarvadaanaani Yagya Homabali Kriyaah. Na Ksheeyate Paatradaanambhayam Sarvadehinaam. All sacrifices, gifts, donations, etc., vanish in their effect after sometime but that which is given to a deserving person survive for ever. Because the deserving receiver utilises the gifts best to further this chain of charity for the welfare of all.<br />

One should always be satisfied (i) with his wife, (ii) with his diet and (iii) with his wealth; but never with (i) his studies, (ii) his austerity and penance and (iii) with his donations and gifts to the deserving persons.<br />

Society Mother, the Supreme God ना नोदकसमं दानं न ितिथद्वादशी समा। न गायात्रया: पर मत्रो नमातु दैवत परम् ।। 43।। Naannodakasamam Daanam Na Tithiddrvaadashee Samaa. Na Gaayattryaah Paro Mantro Na Maturdaivatam Param. No gift is better than the gift of cereal and water, no date is better than the Dwadashi (the twelfth day of the lunar calendar); no Mantra is greater than the Gayatri-Mantra and no god is greater than mother. राजप नी गुरो: प नी िमत्राप नी तथै व च। प नीमाता वमाता च प चै ता: मातर: मृ ता: ।। 44 ।। Raajpatnee Guroh Patnee Mitrapatnee Tathaiv Cha. Patneemaataa Svamaataa Cha Panchaittah Maatarah Smritah. The wife of the king, the wife of the guru, the wife of the friend, the mother of wife and one’s own mother – these five ladies deserve the status of mother.<br />

Annadaataa Bhayatraataa Panchaitaa Pitrah Smritaah. The one who gives birth to you, the one who gets your Upanayan (Sacred Thread) ceremony performed, the one who gives you education, the one who gives you food and the one who protects you from all sort of dangers – these five persons deserve the status of your father ! पुन च िविवधै : शीलै िन्रयो य सतत बु धै। नीित ा शीलस प ना: भिव यि त कुलपूिजता: ।। 46 ।। Punashcha Vividhaih Sheelairniyojjyaa Satatam Budhai. Neetiggyaa Seelasampannaah Bhavishyanti Kulpoojitaah. A wise father must educate his son, in a variety of ways, in making him learn good manners, develop good character and get good knowledge, etc.; because the noble son brings glory to the family and win admiration of their brethren. लालये त ् पंचवषािण दशवषीिण ताडये त।्<br />

Rear up your son affectionately till he is five year old then admonish him strictly for next ten years. When he turns sixteen, start treating him as your friend.<br />

The Worthy Son एकेनािप सु पत्रोण िव ायु ते च साधुना। आ हािदतं कुलं सव यिच द्रे ण शवरी ।। 48।। Ekenaapi Suputrena Viddyayukte Cha Sadhuna. Aahladitam Kulam Sarva Yatha Chandren Sharvari. A wise, well educated and worthy son alone is enough to bring glory to the family like the lonely moon is enough to bedight the night with charms. एकेनािप सु पत्रोण पु ि पते नसु गंिधना। विसतं त नं सव सु पुतर् ोण कुलं यथा ।। 49।। Ekenaapi Suputren Pushpiten Sugandhinaa. Vasitam Taddvanam Sarva Suputren Kulam Yatha. One well blossomed and sweet smelling flower is enough to turn the whole garden fragrant. Similarly, one worthy son is enough to bring glory to the whole family. िकं जातै बहुिभ: पु तर् ौ: शोकस तापकारकै:। वरमे क: कुलावल बी यत्र िवश्रा यते कुलम्।। 50।। Kim Jaatairbahurbhih Putraih Shoksantaapkaarkaih. Varmekah Kulaavalambi Yatra Vishraammyate Kulam. No use having many sons causing worry and sorrow. One worthy son is enough who may support the entire family. एकोऽ गु णवान पु तर् ा: िनगु णै च शतै वरम्। एक च द्र तमो हि द न च तारा सह त्राश: ।। 51।। Ekoapi Gunavaan Putrah Nirgunaisheha Shatairvaram. Ekashchandramasto Hantinacha Taaraa Shastrashah. One worthy son is better than a hundred incompetent and useless sons. The moon is capable enough of destroying the darkness, which even thousands of stars fail to achieve.<br />
<br />
The Incompetent Son<br />
<br />
एकेन शु कवृ े ण द मानेन। द ते त नं सव कुपु तर् ोण कुलं यथा।। 52।। Eken Shuskvrikshen Dahiyamaanen Vahinnanaa. Dahyate Taddvanam Sarva Kuputren Kulam Yathaa. Just as, one dry tree on catching fire can burn the whole orchard to ashes, similarly, one incompetent and bad son ruins the entire family. िक तया िक् रयते धे वा या न दो ध्री न गिभणी। कोऽथ: पु तर् ोण जाते न यो न िव ा न भि तामन् ।। 53।। Ki tayaa Kriyate Dhennvaa Yaana Doggdhree na Garbhinee. Koarthah Putren Jaaten Yon a Viddvaana Bhaktimaan. What value is of that cow, which neither conceives nor gives milk? The same way what worth is of that son who is neither educated (or a scholar) nor devoted to God? मूखि चरायुजातोऽिप त मा जाता मृ तो वरम्। मृ त:स चा पदु :खाय याव जीवं जडो दहे त ् ।। 54।। Moorkhashchiraayurjaatoapi Tassmaattjaataannmrito Varam. Mritahsa Chalpadukhaaya Vavajjeevam Jado Dahet. It is better for a foolish son to die early rather than survive long, because by dying he would give sorrow only once but by surviving he would cause grief and sorrow every moment of his survival by his repeated acts of foolishness. A worthless son is better dead than alive.<br />
<br />
Wife सा भाया या शु िचद स भाया या पितव्रता। सा भाया या पितप्रीता सा भाया स यवािदनी: ।। 55।। Saa Bhaaryaa Shuchidakshaa Saa Bhaaryaa Yaa Pativratta. Saa Bhaaryaa Yaa Patipreetaa saa Bhaaryaa Sttyavaadineehee. (True) wife is that who is pious and deft (in her work), who is faithful to her husband, who loves her husband and who is truthful to her husband. [Chanakya lists five qualities for an ideal wife: she ought to be pious, deft, faithful, loving and truthful to her husband.] प युरा ां िबना नारी उपो य व्रतचािरणी। आयु य हरते भतु :सा नारी नरकं व्रजे त ् ।। 56।। Patturaagyaam Binaa Naaree Uposhya Vratchaarinee. Aayushya Harte Bhartuhsaa Naaree Narakam Vrajet. That wife who takes a resolve without seeking her husband’s permission for it verily shortens her husband’s life. Such women are consigned to hell when they die.<br />
<br />
Woman त्रीणा द्िवगु ण अहारो ल जा चािप चतु गुणा। साहसं षडगु णं चै व काम चा टगु ण: मृ त: ।। 57।। Streenaa Dvigun Ahaaro Lajjaa Chaapi Chaturgunaa. Saahasam Shadgunam Chaiv Kaamashchachaashatgunah Smritah. (In comparison to a man ) A woman is having two times more appetite, four times more shyness, six times more courage and eight times more the sexual desire. अनृ तं साहसं माय मूख वमितलोिभता। अशौच वं िनदय वं त्रीणां दोषा: वभावजा: ।। 58।। Anritam Saahasam Maayaa Moorkhattvamatilobhitaa. Asshauchaatvam Nirdayattvam Streenaam Doshaah Svabhaavajaah. A woman, by nature, is liar, courageous, deceitful, foolish, greedy, impious and cruel. These are the innate attributes of a woman. िव े न र यते धमो िव ा योगे न र यते । ु ा र यते भूप: सित् त्रया र यते गृ हम् ।। 59।। मृ दन Vittyen Rakshayate Dharmo Viddya Yogen Rakshayate. Mridunaa Rakshayate Bhoopah Satishtriyah Rakshatate Griham. Wealth protects Dharma, Yoga protects education or knowledge, suavity protects king and a good woman protects home. [Chanakya says that for maintaining Dharma some material resources are needed which can be procured only by money; Yoga here means application. Obviously, knowledge decays when not applied. According to Chanakya a rough – tough ruler is ill suited for the job. It is only by suavity or apparent softness that he can win over people easily. The last observation is too true to need any clarification. न दानात् शु त्रते नारी नोपवोसै : शतैरिप। न तीथसे वया त द् भतु : पादोदकैयथा ।। 60।। Na Daanaat Shuddhatrate Naaree Vopvasaih Shatairaop. Na Teerthasevayaa Taddvad Bhartuh Paadodakairyathaa. A women doesn’t become as pious by giving alms, performing rigid austerities and fasts and visiting sacred places as by having the water she gets after washing her husband’s feet. यो मोहय म यते मूढ़ो र तेयं मिय कािमनी। स त य वशगो भृ वा नृ ये त् क् रीडा शकु तवत् ।। 61।। Yo Mohayanmannyate Moodho Rakteyam Mayi Kaamine.

The foolish man who, under the infatuation, believes that a particular beautiful woman has fallen for him verily dances to her tune as though he is her plaything! ज पि त सा म ये न प य तय यं सिवभ्रमा:। दये िच तय त यं न त्रीणामे कतो रित: ।। 62।। Jalpanti Saardhamannyen Pashyanttyannyam Savibhramaah. Hridaye Chintayanttyaannyam Na Streenaamekato Ratih. Women have a knack of talking to one man, casting an askew glance at other and loving secretly a third man. They can’t devotedly love just one man. वरये कुलजां प्रा ो िन पामािप क यकाम्। पशीलां न नीच यां िववाह: सदृशे कुले ।। 63।। Varyettkuljaam Praggyo Niroopaamapi Kannyakkam. Roopsheelaam Na Neechassyaam Vivaah Sadrishe Kule. A wiseman shouldn’t hesitate marrying an ugly girl, if she happens to belong to a reputed good family. But if a girl is extremely beautiful, the wiseman shouldn’t marry her if she is from a lowly, ill-reputed family. A matromonial alliance is best established between the families of equal status. िवषाद यमृ तं ग्रा ममे यादिप कांचनम्। नीचाद यु मां िव ां त्रीर नं दु कुलादिप ।। 64।। Vishaadppyamritam Graahyamameddhyaadapi Kaanchanam. Neechadappyuttamaam Viddyaam Streeratnam Dushkulaadapi. Do not hesitate in getting nectar even from poision if it be available and gold even from the filth. Accept good knowledge even from a pariah and good girl even from a low family. [Both these aphorisms state contradictory observations. While the above one says don’t marry a girl from a low family even if she be good and virtuous, the Shloka below asserts marrying a virtuous girl even if belonging to low caste or a low family].<br />
<br />
The Parents माता शत् : िपता वैरी ये न बालो न पािठत:। न शोभते सभामये हंसमये बको यथा ।। 65 ।। Maataa Shatruh Pitaa Vairee Yen Baalo Na Pathitaha. Na Shobhate Sabhaa Maddhye Hansamddhye Bako Yathaa. Those parents who don’t take interest in their son’s education (or who don’t provide him with good education) are verily his enemies. An illiterate man among the literate ones looks as ugly as a crow among the swans. ऋ कता िपता शत् माता च यिभचािरणी। भाया पवती शत् : पु तर् शत् न पंिडत: ।। 66 ।।<br />
<br />
Rinakartaa Pitaa Shatrurmaataa Cha Vyabhichaarinee. Bhaaryaa Roopavatee Shatruh Putrashatnurn Panditah. A father bequeathing the loan; a mother of loose morals; a wife extremely beautiful and a foolish son – all should be deemed as enemies.<br />
<br />
Mutual Relationship ते पूतर् ा ये िपतृ भ ता स िपता य तु पोषक:। ति मत्राम् यत्रा िव वास: सा भाया या िनवृ ि : ।। 67 ।। Te Putra Ye Pitrabhakta Sa Pita Yastu Poshakah. Tanmitram Yatra Vishvaasah Saa Bharyaa Yaa Nivratih. The (real) son is he who is devoted to his father; the (real) father is he who looks after his son well and rears him up with care; the (real) friend is who is trusted one and the (real) wife is she who delights her husband’s heart.<br />
<br />
Home यिद रामा यिद च रमा यिद तनयो िवनयगणोपे त:। तनयो तनयो पि : सुरवरनगरे िकाि यम् ।। 68 ।। Yadi Raamaa Yadi Cha Ramaa Yad Tanya Vinay Ganopetah. Tanyo Tanyotpattih Survarnagare Kimaadhikkyam. That home, beats even the divine pleasures hollow which has a virtuous lady, a noble-natured and promising son with his own son (grandson) and enough riches. न िवप्रपादोदक पंिकलािन न वे दशा त्राविनगिजतािन। वाहा वधकारविनविजतािन मशानतु यािन गृ हािण तािन ।। 69 ।। Na Vipprapaadodak Pankilaani Na Vedshaastraddhivanigarjtaani. Svaahaasvadhaakaarddhvanivrajitaani Shmashaantullyani Grihaani Taani. That home which is not smeared by the mud and dust brought in by the scholarly brahman’s feet; where no sound of chanting of the ‘Veda-Mantras’ is heard; from where the reverberations made at the time of offering oblation to the sacred fire: [SWAHA-SWAHA, etc.] do not originate is verily as inauspicious and eerie as a crematorium.<br />

Tasmaannmoolam Yattnato Rakshaneeyam Chhinne Moolen Naiv Shakhaa Na Patram. The Vipra (scholarly brahmans) is the tree whose root is the Vedic Hymn chanted every evening and morning, worship the religious and ritual acts being the leaves. The root of the tree must be protected at every cost as the whole tree derive strength from it. If the root is lost then neither the leaves would remain nor the branches. ध या द्िवजमयीं नौका िवपरीता भवाणवे । तर तधे गता सव उपि थता पत ये व िह ।। 71 ।। Dhannya Dvijamayeem Nauka Vipreetaa Bhavaarnave. Tarannttyadhogataa Sarve Upasthitaa Patannyeva Hi. This boat, in the form of the brahman, going across the sea of existence is typical as it moves in a reverse order. Those who remain below it go across easily but those who try to ride over it fall down and gets drowned [It is a symbolic representation of the assertion that those who remain below the brahman’s fair better in this mundane sea of existence and successfully cross at. But those who try to defy the authority of the brahmans meet their ruin.] एकाहारे ण स तु ट : षड्कमिनरत: सदा। त्रातु काले ऽिभगामी च स िवप्रो द्िवज उ चयते ।। 72 ।। Ekahaaren Santushtah Shadkarmaniratah Sadda. Ritukaaliabhigaamee Cha Sa Vippro Dvij Uchchyate. That brahman who eats only once in the day, devotes his time in studies and in practising various austerities and who copulates with his wife only during her Ritu Kal (the period immediately after the menses is called the Dwij or the twice born). अकृ ट फलमूलािन वनवासरत: सदा। कु ते ऽहरह: श्रा मृ िषिवप्र: स उ यते ।। 73 ।। Akrishta Phalmoolani Vanvaasaratah Sadda. Kurteaharh Shraaddhamishirvipprah Sa Uchchyate. The brahman who eats only roots and bulbs produced from the land untilled, who ever dwells in jungles and performs the Shraaddha [of his departed ancestors] everyday is called a Rishi (sage). लौिकके कमिण रत: पशूनां पिरपालक:। वािण यकृिषकमा य: स िवप्रो वै य उ यते ।। 74 ।। Laukike Karmaani Ratah Pashoonaam Paripaalakah.<br />
<br />
Vaanijjyakrishikarmaa Yah Sa Vippro Vaishya Uchchyate. The brahman who ever remains busy in the mundane work, who owns and tends to cattle; who tills the land and does farming is known as Vaishya (Merchant class) Brahman. [Chanakya is trying to assert that one’s social category is not defined by birth but by one’s profession.] ला ािद तैलनीलानां कौसु भमघुसिवषान्। िवक् रेता म ामांसानां स िवप्र शूद ्र उ यते ।। 75 ।। Lakshaadi Tailneelaanaam Kausumbhmadhusavishaan. Vikreta Maddyamaanasaanaam Sa vipprya Shoodra Uchchyate. The brahman who sells lac and its products oil indigo plant, flowers’ honey, ghee, wine, meat and its product is called a Shudra Brahman (Low Caste Brahman). दे वद्र यं गु द्र यं परदारािभमषणम्। िनवाह: सवभूतेषु िवप्र चा डाल उ चते ।। 76 ।। Devadravyam Gurudravyam Pardaaraabhimarshanam. Nirvaah Sarvabhooteshu Vipprashchaandaol Uchchyate. The brahman who steals the things belonging to the Gurus and gods, copulates with other ’s wife and is able to dewll amongst the beings of any species is called a Pariah-Brahman. वापीकू पतड़गानामारामसुखेल वनाम्। उ छे दने िनराशंक से िवप्रो ले छ उ चयते ।। 77 ।। Vaapeekoopat Daagaanaamaaraamsulcheshvanaam. Uchchedane Niraashank Se Vippro Mlechcha Uchchyate. The brahman who recklessly destroys the temples, wells, ponds and orchards without any fear of social repercussion is verily a Mlechha (infidel) Brahman. परकायिवह ता च दाि भक: वाथसाधक:। छली े षी सदुक् रो माजार उ यते ।। 78 ।। Parkaaryavihantaa cha daambhikah Svaarthasaadhakaah. Chaleedveshee Sadukrooro Maarjaar Uchchyate. The brahman who puts hurdles in other ’s ways, who is deceitful, scheming, cruel bearing ill-will for others, sweet by tongue but foul by heart is called a Tom-Cat Brahman. अथाधीता च यै वदा तथा शूद ्रा नभे िजन:। ते द्िवजा: िकं किर यि त िनिवषा इव प नगा: ।। 79 ।। Arthaadheetaashcha Yairvedaastatha Shooddrannabhojnah.

Gehan mey Chedyanti Pratidivasmamaakaant Poojaanimittat Tasmaat Khinna sadaaham Dvij Kulnilayam Naath Yuktam Tyajaami. He who in his rage drank up my sire, the sea; who wrathfully kicked my husband; who from an early childhood bear my enemy Saraswati upon his tongue; who plucks off my lotus to offer them in worshop of Lord Shiva-he or his brethren--the Brahmans--have been bent upon ruining me. Hence I would ever shun going into their houses. [Lakshmi, the Goddess of riches alludes various mythological happenings to Agastya drank up the sea--her father; the sage Bhrigu kicked Lord Vishnu--her husband; all the brahmans get their intitiation in learning by chanting the name of Saraswati, the Goddess of speech and her (Lakshmi’s) arch enemy; and all the brahmans for the worshop of Lord Shiva, pluck off lotus flowers which abound her home. Hence she would never go to the houses of Brahmans, i.e. the brahmans are hound to-stay poor in wealth because of this innate prejudice of the (gooddess Lakshmi.)<br />

He who knows when and where to speak, how to influence people and how to be wrathful or affectionate in what measure is really a wise man or a Pundit.<br />

After smearing oil on the body after getting touched by the funera pyre’s smoke; after copulation and after getting the hair-nails etc, the man remains pariah till he takes bath. पि णां काक चा डाल पशुनां चै व कु कुर:। मुनीनां पाप चा डाल: सवषु िननदक: ।। 84 ।। Paksheenaam Kaakshchaandaal Pashunaam Chaiv Kukkurah.

The learned scholars opine that one Yavan (originally a Greek but commonly understood as any foreigner) is as mean as a thousand pariahs. No one could be meaner than a Yavan. [Herein Chanakya expresses the deep rooted prejudice prevalent during his times.]<br />
<br />
The Guru गु ि नद्िवजातीनां वणानां ब्रा णो गु :। पितरे व गु : त्रीणां सव या यगतो गु : ।। 86 ।। Gururagnidirvajaateenaam Varnaanaam Brahmano Guruh. Patireva Guruh Streenaam Sarvasyaabhyagato Guruh. (The) fire (god) is the guru of the three social categories viz the brahmans, the kshatriya the warrior class, the vaishya the trader or (merchant class), the brahman is the guru of all the social categories except his own. The guru of woman is her husband and the guest is guru of all the inmates of the house. [The guru also means the most respectable person besides being the teacher or mentor or perceptor.]<br />

Kuleen (The Scion of a Noble Descent) एतदथ कुलीनानां नृ पा: कुवि त संगर् हम्।<br />
<br />
आिदमयावसाने षु न यजि त च ते नृ पम् ।। 87 ।। Etadarth Kuleenaanaam Nripaah Kurvanti Sangraham. Aadimaddhyavasaaneshu Na Tyajanti Cha Te Nripam. The Kuleens or the scions of a noble family never ditch or dupe anybody till their last breath. Hence the kings choose to keep them in their courts. िछ नोऽिप च दनत न जहाित ग ध वृ ोऽिप वारणपितन जहाित लीलानम्। य त्रिप्रतो मधुरतां न जहाित चे ु णोऽिप न यजित शीलगु णा कुलीन: ।। 88 ।। Chhinnoapi Chandantarurn Jahaati Gandham Vriddhoapi Vaaranpatirn Jahaati Leelaanam. Yantnrpito Madurtaam Na Jahaarti Chekshu Kshanoapi Na Tyajati Sheelagunaankuleenah. Even when cut off, the sandal wood-tree doesn’t stop giving it’s sweet fragrance; even when old the elephant doesn’t let go his sturdy plays; even when crushed between the curshers the sugarcane continue; to be sweet--the same way the kuleen, even when fallen on evil days doesn’t discard his noble manner and cultured behaviour. यथा चतु िभ: कनकं परी यते िनघषण छे दन तापताड़नै :। तथा चतु िभ: पु ष: परी यते यागे न शीलेन गु णेन कमणा ।। 89 ।। Yathaa Chaturbhih Kanakam Pareekshyate Nirgharshanachedan Taapataadanaih. Tathaa Chaturbhih Purushah Pareekshyate Tyaagen Sheelen Guneen Karmanaa. Like gold is tested by rubbing, cutting, heating and beating so also a man is tested by his sacrifice, moral conduct, innate qualities and his actions.<br />

The Real Beauty दानेन पािणन तु कं कणेन नानेन शुदि् धन तु च दनेन। मानेन तृ िप्तन तु भोजनेन ानेन मु ि तन तु म डनेन ।। 90 ।। Dannen Paanirn Tu Kankanen Snaanen Shuddhirna Tu Chandanen. Maanen Triptirn Tu Bhojanen Gyaanen Muktirna Tu Mandanen.<br />
<br />
Beauty of hands lies in giving alms and not in wearing bracelets; the body becomes clean by taking bath and not by applying sandal wood paste; one feels satisfied by being honoured and not by being fed; one attains to Moksha by knowledge and not by self-decoration [The last one needs an explanation. Moksha is a stage represented by desirelessness; while the process of self-decoration is the outcome of the attempt to satiate the desires, which is intermiable as the desires have a tendency to grow on what they are fed. Obviously the second stage cannot lead to Moksha, which is the ultimate destination of ‘the conscious-soul’]<br />

He who is together with you in festivities, distress, drought, and in the crisis caused by an enemy attack, in the royal courts and in the crematorium is your real friend. िव ा िमत्रां प्रवासे षु भाया िमत्रां गृ हेषु च। याि त यौषिधं िमत्रां धमो िमत्रां मृ त य च ।। 92 ।। Vidhya Mitram Pravaaseshu Bhaaryaa Mitram Grahesh Cha. Vyaadhitasyaushadham Mitram Dharmo Mitram Mritasya Cha. Away from home, in the foreign strand, one’s knowledge is one’s best friend, inside home one’s wife is one’s best friend. For a patient the first friend is efficacious medicine while after death one’s Dharma is one’s best friend. [It is believed that he who is adhered to his Dharma religiously and firmly gets the divine rewards after death.]<br />

Pleasures and Happiness य य पु तर् ो वशीभूतो भाया छ दानु गािमनी। िवभवे य य स तु ि ट त य वग इहैव िह ।। 93 ।। Yasya Putro Vasheebhooto Bharyaa Chandaarugaamini. Vibhave Yasya Santushtistastya Svarga ihaiv Hi. If one has obedient son, a pious wife following the Vedic path and if one is satisfied with his material possessions, one is living verily in the heaven. भो यं भोजनशि त चं रितशि त चं वारांगना। िवभवो दानशि त च ना प य तपस: फलम् ।। 94 ।। Bhojjyam Bhojanshaktishacham Ratishaktishcham Vaaraanganaa.

to enjoy her, getting rich alongwith the capability to dole out elms--are the outcome of one’s no less arduous penance and austerities. स तोषामृ ततृ तानां य सुखं शाि तरे व चे । नच त नलु धनािमत चे त च धवताम् ।। 95 ।। Santoshaamrittriptaanaam Yattsukham Shaantireva Cha.

The nectar of satisfaction begetting peace and happiness cannot available for the people hankering after material riches and physic pleasures. नाि त कामसमो यािधनािस्त मोहसमो िरपु :। नाि त कोप समो वि नाि त ाना परं सुखम् ।। 96 ।। Naasti Kaamasamo Vyaadhirnaasti Mohasamo Ripuh. Naasti Kopasamo Vahanirnaasti Gyaanaatparam Sukham. Uncontrollable sexual craving is the most deadly disease, ignorance and infatuation are the most deadly foes, wrath is the most deadly fire and knowledge of the self is the happiness supreme. माता चकमला दे वी िपता दे वो जनादन:। बा वा िव णु भा ता च वदे शो भूवनत्रायम् ।। 97 ।। Maataa Cha Kamallaa Devi Pitaa Devo Janaardanah. Baandhavaa Vishnubhakttaashcha Svadesho Bhuvantrayam. He who has his mother like the Goddess Laksmi, father like Lord Vishnu and brothers and other close relations like devotees of Lord Vishnu dwells in a house replete with all the pleasures of the three realms (the heaven, the earth and the nether world of Patal-lok ).<br />

Dariddra Bhaavo Vishyaa Sabhaa Cha Vinaagnimete Pradahanti Kaayam. Separation from the beloved, insult by the close relations, unpaid debt, service to a wicked king poverty and association of the crooked persons incinerate the body even without fire. कुग्रामवास: कुलहीन से वा कुभोजनं क् रो मुखी च भाया।<br />

Residence in the village of wicked persons, service to lowly family, unnourishing food, foul speaking wife, foolish sons, widowed daughter – all these incinerate the body even without fire. वृ काले मृ ता भाया ब धु ह तगतं धनम्। भोजनं च पराधीनं ित त्र पुसां िवड बना ।। 100 ।। Vriddhakaale Mritaa Bhaaryaa Bandhuhastagatam Dhanam. Bhojanam Cha Paraadheenam Tishtrapusaam Vidambanaa. Death of wife in the old age, money under brother ’s control and the dependence on others for daily bread cause a great anamoly, hence grief in one’s life. क टं च खलु मूख वं क टं खलु यौवनम्। क टा क टरं चै व परगे हिनवासनम् ।। 101 ।। Kashtam Cha Khalu Moorkhattvam Kashtam Cha Khalu Yauvanam. Kashtaattkashtakaram Chaiv Pargehenivaaasaham. Although the foolishness (of the self) and (insurmountable) youthful exuberance cause grief yet the greatest grief is caused by one’s (forced) stay at other ’s house. अयममृ तणिनधनं नायको औषधीनां अमृ तमयशरीर: काि तयु तोऽिप च द्रा:। भवित िवगतरि मम डले प्रा य भानो: परसदनिनिव ट: को न लघु वं याित ।। 102 ।। Ayamamritnanidhaanam Naayako Aushadheenaam Amritmaya Shareerah Kaantiyuktoapi Chandrah.

This fount of vitality, the lord of all medicines, this moon with the body made of nectar and the shine enchanting, grows how splendourless the moment it arrives in the halo of the sun. Who doesn’t lose stature by stepping in other ’s house ? [ it is believed that all herbs and vegetation – the source of medicine –derive their efficacious potency from the rays of the moon which is said to be made of nectar. Despite its all natural splendour and gifts even the moon loses its charm the moment the sun rises i.e., the moment it survives beyond darkness and tries to enter the house of the sun that is the day-time.] अनवि थकाय य न जने न वने सुखम्।<br />

He whose mind is not steady doesn’t get happiness either amongst the people or in the loneliness of the jungle. When lonely he longs for company and when in company he yearns for loneliness. संसारातपद धनां त्रायो िवराि तहे तव:। अप यं च कलत्रां च सतां संगितरे व च ।। 104 ।। Sansaaraatpadaghaanam Trayo Vishraantihetavah. Apattyam Cha Kaltram Cha Sataam Sangatirev Cha. Those who are signed by the mundane fare get solace only under three conditions staying with the son, with the wife or in the company of the noble person. [It means a persons tired and dwadled by the mundane duties gets solace in the company of his family or of the noble gentle persons. Such a company rejuvenates his exhausted physique and over worked mind.]<br />

Knowledge or Education पयौवनस पना िवशालकुलसंभवा:। िव ाहीना न शोभ ते िनग ध इव िकं शु का: ।। 105 ।। Roopyauvahsampanna Vishaatkulsambhavah. Viddyaaheena Na Shobhante Nirgandhaa Iv Kinshukaah. Despite having a well endowed physique; beauty charms and belonging to a high and big family if a man is uneducated or ignorant, he looks as useless and unimpressive as the kinshuk (palaash) flowers having only colour but no fragrance. कामधे नुगुणा िव ा यकाले पफलदाियनी। प्रवासे भातृसदृशा िव ा गु तं धनं मृ तम् ।। 106 ।। Kamdhenugunaa Viddyaa Hayakaale Phaladaayani. Pravaase Bhaatrisadrisha Viddyaa Guptam Dhanam Smritam. Knowledge (or education) is like the cow of plenty, giving good things even in the most adverse period in the foreign strands;it protects like mother and renders help as though it is a veritable secret treasure. वानपु छिमव यथ जीिवतं िव या िबना। न गृ ं गोपने श तं न च दंशिनवारणे ।। 107 ।। Shvaanpuchchamiv Vyarth Jeevitam Viddyayaa Binaa. Na Griham Gopane Shaktam Na Cha Darshanivaarne. An illiterate person’s life is as useless as the tail of a dog neither capable of covering its privities<br />
<br />
nor in warding off the flies and mosquitoes. [Chanakya says that without education or knowledge life has no value. Neither it can take out the wants nor it can provide comfort to the unfortunate man.] िव ान् प्रश यते लोके िव ान् सवत्रा गौरवम्। िव या लभते सव िव ा सवत्रा पू यते ।। 108 ।। Viddvaan Prashaste Loke Viddvaan Sarvatra Gauravam. Viddyayaa Labhate Sarva Viddyaa Sarvatra Poojyate. An educated man – a scholar gets accolades from all and earn reputation in the society. Since education helps to one get everything on desires in life, it is adored everywhere. दूतो न सचिरत खे न चले च वाता पूव न जिलपतािमंद न च संगमोऽि त। योि निस्म ं रिवशिशग्रहणं प्रश तं जानाित यो द्िवजवर: स कथ न िव ान् ।। 109 ।। Dooto Na Sancharit Khe na Challechch Vaartaa Poorvam Na Jalpitmidam Na Cha Sangamoasti. Vyomnismim Ravipshashigrahanam Prashstam Janati Yo Dvijavarah Sa Katham Na Viddvan. Neither a messenger could be sent to the sky not any communication could be established nor anyone told us about anyone existing there, still the scholars predict with great precision about the Solar and Lunar eclipses. Who would hesitate in calling them the very erudite scholars?<br />

Students सुखाथी चे त ् ये जेदि् व ां िव ाथी चे त ् यजे यसुखम्। सुखािथन: कुतो िव ा कुतो िव ािथन: सुखम् ।। 110 ।। Sukhaarthee Chet Tyejedviddyaam Viddyaarthee Chet Tyajettsukam. Sukhaartheenah Kuto Viddyaa Kuto Viddyaarthinah Sukham. If one craves for comfort, then he should drop the idea of studying and if one wants to study sincerely then he should stop craving for comfort. One cannot get comfort and education simultaneously. कामं क् रोध्ं तथा लोभं वाद श्रृंगाकौतु कम्। अितिनद्राऽितसे वा च िव ाथी ा ट वजये त ् ।। 111 ।। Kaamam Krodham tathaa Lobham Svaad Shringaarkautukam. Atinidraatisevaa cha Viddyaarthee Hayaashta Varjayet. A student desirous of getting education must shun the following right activities— sexual intercourse, gratification of the tongue, showing anger and greed, caring for personal beautification, moving about the fair and fate for entertainment, excessive sleeping and indulging in anything excessively. [In short Chanakya says that for getting education the student must perform a rigorous<br />
<br />
penance complete with all the severe austerities. He who tries to get education in comfort fails to get it in reality and vice versa.] यथा खिन व खिनत्रोण भूतले वािर िव दित। तथा गु गतां िव ां शुश् षुरि ग छित ।। 112 ।। Yathaa Khanittvaa Khanitren Bhootale Vaari Vindati. Tathaa Gurugataam Viddyaam Shushrushuradhigachhati. Like one digs the ground deep by a mattock to bring out water, so should a student attempt to get knowledge from one’s Guru. [One has to toil very hard to get water from the depth of earth. Chanakya says that the same way a student should toil and render strenuous service to his Guru to get knowledge from him. एका रं प्रदातारं यो गु ं नािभव दते । वानयोिन शतं भु तवा चा डाले विभजायते ।। 113 ।। Ekaaksharam Pradaataaram Yo guruam Naabhivandate. Shvaanyoni Shatam Bhuktavaa Chaandaaleshvabhijaayate. He who doesn’t pay obeisance to his Guru even after receiving the knowledge of the Ekakshar Mantra (the mono syllable ‘OM’) gets hundred births in the dog’s species and then becomes a pariah in human life. पु तकं प्र याधीतं नाधीतं गु सि नधौ। सभाम ये न शोभ ते जारगभा इव ि त्राय: ।। 114 ।। Pustakam Prattyaadheetam Naadheetam Gurusannidhau. Sabhamaddhye Na Shobhante Jaargarbhaiv Istriyah. He who tries to get knowledge only by reading books and not through the grace of a Guru deserves the position in a society due only to a woman impregnated through an illegal relationship. [A strong upholder of the Guru-Shishya tradition, Chanakya considers that to be no knowledge at all which is received without the Guru’s teaching. He asserts, and very rightly so, that such a knowledge would be incomplete and hence damaging.] िकं कुलेन िवशालेन िव ाहीने च दे िहनाम्। दु कुलं चाऽिप िवदुषो दे वैरिप िह पू यते ।। 115 ।। Kim Kulen Vishaalen Viddyaaheene Cha Dehinaam. Duskulam Chapi Vidusho Devarirapi Hi Poojyate. An uneducated person is wrothless even if he might be belonging to a renowned family. A scholar, despite belonging to a low rated family, is adored by even the gods. धनहीनो न च हीन च धिनक स सु िन चय:। िव ा र नेन हीनो य: स हीन: सवव तु षु:।। 116 ।। Dhanheeno na Cha heenashcha Dhanik sa Sunishchayah.<br />
<br />
Viddhya Ratnen Heeno Yah Sa Heenah Sarvavstushuh. A man devoid of wealth is in fact not a poor man. He might become wealthy. But one who is uneducated is actually a pauper in all aspects. एकमे वा रं य तु : गु : िश टां प्रबोधये त।् पृ िथ यां नाि त त र् यं यद् द वा दानृ णे भवे त् ।। 117 ।। Ekamevaaksharam Yastuh Guruh Shishtaam Prabodhayet. Prithivyaam Naasti Taddravyam Yad Daatvaa Daanrino Bhavet. The Guru who enlightens (his pupils) by mono-syllable Mantra (‘OM’) obliges (them) so deeply that nothing on earth can repay this obligation to him. [The pupils who receive such education from their Guru can never undebt themselves.<br />
<br />
Worship of the Virtue गु णा: सवत्र पू य ते न मह योऽिप स पद:। पूण दु िकं तथा व ो िन कलंको यथा कुश: ।। 118 ।। Gunaah Sarvatra Poojyante Na Mahattyoapi Sampadah. Poornendu Kim Tathaa Vanddyo Nishkalenko Yatha Kushah. It is virtue, which is adored everywhere and not the riches or even excess of them. Does the full moon is accorded the same respect as given to the weaker moon ? [Chanakya impliedly says that the initial phase of the moon, specifically the moon of the second day is accorded greater regard because the stains of the moon are not visible at this stage, which the full moon, despite being more luminous, has its stains clearly defined. It is only the blemishless part of the moon that is accorded the greater respect. Similarly, a rich-man with huge property would not command greater respect, if he is not virtuous or free from blemish, than the person having much less money or riches but more virtuous and untainted by any blemish.] िववे िकनमनु पर् ा तो गु णो याित मनो ताम्। सु तरां र नमाभाित चामीकरिनयोिजतम्।। 119 ।। Vivekinmunuprapato Guno Yaati Manogyataam. Sutaraam Rattnamaabhaati Chaameekarniyojitam. Virtues gleam more when these are in a wise person like a gem adding to the beauty when embedded in gold. गु णं सवत्रा तु योऽिप सीद ये को िनराश्रय:। अनयमिप मिण यं हे मारयमपे ते ।। 120 ।। Gunam Sarvatra Tullyoapi Seedttyeko Niraashrayah. Anadharyamapi Maanikkyam Hemaashrayamapekshate, If left without a proper support, even the virtuous gets distressed. However blemishless be a gem, it<br />
<br />
needs a base to shine from. स यं माता िपता ानं धमो भ्राता दया सखा। शाि त: प नी मा पु तर् ा: षडे ते मम बा वा: ।। 121 ।। Sattyani Maataa Pitaa Gyaanam Dharmo Bhraataa Dayaa Sakhaa. Shaantih Pattni Kshmaa Putrah Shatete Mam Bandhavaah. Truth is my mother, knowledge is father, my Dharma is my brother, compassion my friend, peace is my wife and forgiveness is my son. These six virtues are my real relations, the rest are all false! यालाश्रयािप िवपफलािप सक टकािप वक् रािप पंकसिहतािप दुरासदािप। ग धे न ब धुरिस केतिक सवज तो-रे को गु ण: खलु िनहि त सम तदोषान् ।। 122 ।। Vyaalaashrayaapi Viphalaapi Sakantkaapi Vakraapi Pankasahitaapi Duraasadaapi. Gandhen Bandhurasi Ketaki Sarvajantoreko Gunah Khalu Nihanti Samastdoshaan. O Ketaki (pandanus)! Inspite of your being the dwelling place of the snakes, your being a fruitless– full of thorns–shurb originating in the mud and accessible with great difficulty, still you are dear to all because of your sweet fragrance. Most certainly one good virtue haloes every other defect. गु णै मतां याि त नो चैरासनसंि थतै :। प्रासादिशखर थोिप िकं काको ग डायते ।। 123 ।। Gunairuttamattaam Yaanti Nochairaasansansthitai. Praasaadshikharasthoapi Kim Kaako Garudaayate. It is virtues, which enhance one’s stature and not the high position. Even if perched atop a royal palace, a crow cannot become Garur (the acquila bird of mythological origin, believed to be the lord of the birds). परमो तगु णो य तु िनगु णोऽिप गु णी भवे त्। इ द्रोऽिप लघु तां याित वयं प्र यािपतै गुणै : ।। 124 ।। Paramoktaguno Yastu Nirgunoapi Gunee Bhavet. Indroapi Laghutaam Yaati Svayam Prakhyaapitaairgunaih. If others praise even the virtueless person, he may acquire some status, but even if Indra (the lord of the gods) starts praising his own virtues he will be little his stature.<br />
<br />
Wisdom य य नाि त वयं प्र ा शा त्रां त य करोित िकम्। लोचना यां िवहीन य दपणं िकं किर यित ।। 125 ।।<br />
<br />
Yasya Naasti Svayam Pragyaa Shaastram Tassya Karoti Kim. Lochanaabhyaam Viheenasya Darpanam Kim Karishyati. What can all the scriptures do for a person devoid of his own wisdom? What use has a mirror for a blind man? अ त:सारिवहीननामु पदे शो न जायते । मलयाचलसंसपा न वे णु च दनायते ।। 126 ।। Antahsaarviheenanaamupdesho na Jaayate. Malyaachal Sansarpaanna Venushchandanaayate. All sermons are wasted on a person devoid of wisdom. Even if grown in the Malayaachal (the area abounding with sandal trees) the bamboo cannot become the sandalwood! न वे ि यो य य गु णप्रकष्र स तु सदा िन दंित नात्रा िचत्राम्। यथा िकराती किरकु भल धं मु तां पिर य य िवभित गु चाम् ।। 127 ।। Na vetti Yo Yassya Gunaprakarsha Sa tu sadaa Nindanti Naatra Chittram. Yatha Kiraati Karikumbhalabdhaam Muktaam Parittyaajya Vibharti Gunchaam. No wonder if anyone not aware of certain virtues derides them. Kirati (the Bhil woman) would happily discard the pearls found in elephants’ head for the Gunjas (the common, cheap beads) and wear them in the necklace. [Since the Bhil woman is not aware of the high value of pearls found in the elephants’ head, she rejects them for the common beads. दानािथनो मधु करा यिद कणतालै दूरीकृता किरवरे ण मदा बु ा। त यै व ग डयु गम डनहािनरे व भृ ंगा: पुनिवकचपद्मवने वसि त ।। 128 ।। Daanaarthino Madhukaraa Yadi Kana taalai Doorikritaa Kanivaren Madaandbuddhayaa. Tasyaiv Gandayugamandanahaanireva Bhirgaah Punarvikachapaddmavane Vasanti. Blinded by his intoxication, the elephant sent away the Bhanwars (Black-bees), warding them off by the movement of his ears. The loss was not of the Bhanwars but of the elephant as his visage lost the charm. The Bhanwars went back to the cluster of lotus flowers. [The young elephants have their ears discharge a sweet smelling substance, which attracts the black-bees. The herd of black-bees around the elephant’s head add to the charm of the pachyderm’s face. When he shoos them away by fluttering his ears, it is the elephant that loses his charms not the bees, which go back to the cluster of lotus flowers. Meaning thereby that if the fools do not give respect to the virtues, it is they who suffer the loss not the virtues, which have many admirers.]<br />
<br />

Even if a fool reads the four Vedas and other scriptures but he cannot realise the self like the ladle, repeatedly entering the food, fails to discern the taste of the food.<br />
<br />
Great Man अधी ये दं यथाशा त्रां नरो जानाित स म:। धमोपदे शिव यातं कायाकायशु भाशु भम् ।। 130 ।। Adheettyedam Yathaashaastram Naro Jaanaati Sattamah. Dharmopadeshvikhyaatam Kaaryaaa Kaayashubhashubham. He is really a great man who derives the real meaning after reading these aphorisms (collection of the pithy sayings on morality) detailing what one should and what one shouldn’t do; what is Dharma and what is not; and what is auspicious and what is not. अहो ि वत् िविचत्रािण चिरतािन महा मनाम्। ल मीं तृ णाय मनय ते तद्भरे ण नमि त च ।। 131 ।। Aho Svit Vichitraani Charitaani Mahaattmanaam. Laxammem Trinaaya Mannyante Taddbharen Namanti cha. All the great men have a typical character. Though they deem the Goddess Lakshmi (riches) as though she is a mere straw but they get suppressed by her weight. [Chanakya says that the great men do not attach much importance to the riches but as they grow rich, they become more and more submissive and humble.] वगि थतानािमह जीवलोके च वािर िच ािन वसि त दे हे। दानप्रसंगो मधुरा च वाणी दे वाचनं ब्रा णतपणं च ।। 132 ।। Svargamsthitaanaamih Jeevaloke Chattvaari Chinnhaaani VAsanti Dehe. Daanprasango Madhura Cha Vaani Devaarchanam Braahamantarpanam cha. He who has sweet voice, who worships the gods and keeps the brahmans satisfied and who takes interest in giving alms is actually a divine soul in this mundane realm. He is a great man who has all these four qualities. यु गा ते प्रचले मे : क पा ते स त सागरा:। सा व: प्रितप नाथ न चलि त कदाचन ।। 133 ।।<br />
<br />
Yugaante Prachalenmeruch Kalpaanted Sapta Saagaraah. Saadhavah Pratipannarthaanna Chalanti Kadaanchan. The sumeru Mountain may be displaced from its position at the end of an epoch or all the seven seas may be disturbed at the end of a Kalp [a very big unit of time containing twenty seven cycles of the epochs (yugs), each containing four yugas : Satya, Treta, Dwapar and Kaliyug] but the great noble men never waver from their chosen path. अयु त वािमनो यु तं यु तं नीच य दूषणम्। अमृ तं राहवे मृ यु िवषं शंकभूषणम् ।। 134 ।। Ayiktasvaamino Yuktam Yuktam Neechasya Dooshanam. Amritam Raahave Mrittyurisham Shanker bhooshanam. Getting an able owner even the worthless thing becomes useful and adorable while a worthless owner ruins the value of a priceless thing. Lord Shankar made even the deadly poison an ornament of his throat while Rahu, the demon got beheaded even when he had sipped nectar. [Chanakya alludes two mythological events to bring home his Point, At the time of that “Mighty Churning of the Seas” by the demons and the gods, when deadly poison surfaced, for the welfare of entire creation, Lord Shankar drank it but didn’t let it go down the throat which turned blue by the excessive toxicity of the poison. But even that poison earned him an epithet the ‘blue-throated’ or the ‘Neelkantha’. When nectar surfaced by that Churning, the gods and the demons began to fight for it. Then Lord Vishnu assumed the form of a beautiful woman ‘Mohini’ and began to pour it down the throat of the gods. Seeing through the game of Lord Vishnu, one of the demons, Rahu jumped to the side of the gods, in disguise, to receive nectar. But the moment he took a sip of that divine (ion, the sun-god and the moon god exposed him and Lord Vishnu there and then beheaded him by his Chakra (disc). But since he had chit- in his throat, he couldn’t be dead despite his head being hacked off. Since then, it is belived mythologically that the head is surviving separately as Rahu and his trunk as Ketu.] अधमा निम छछि त धनं मानं च मयमा:। उ मा मानिम छि त मानो िह महतां धनम् ।। 135 ।। Adhamaa Dhanamichanti Dhanam Maanan cha Maddhyamaah Uttamaa. Maanamichanti Maano Hi Mahataam Dhanam. The mean aspire only for wealth, the mediocre yearn for wealth and honour both while the nobles care only for honour. The real treasure of great men is only honour. प्रा त त ू प्रसंगेन मयो त्रीप्रसंगत:। रात्रौ चौरप्रसंगेन कालो ग छित धीमताम् ।। 136 ।। Praapta Dhyutprasangen Madhyaahne Streeprasangatah. Ratrau Chaurprasangen Kalo Gachhati Dheetaam. The greatmen-scholars pass their mornings in gambling, afternoon with women and nights with thieves. This is how they pass their time. [Chanakya’s intelligent allusion provide great sense in this otherwise and apparently-atrocious observation. Speaking epigrammatically, he hints that the great men pass their mornings in reading the Mahabharat which resulted out of the gambling addiction of<br />
<br />
Yundhisthar. The Mahabharata highlights the general weakness of human Characters. So the great scholars first concentrate on human follies to guard against them. In the afternoon they study the Ramayana which tells them about the dreadful consequences of the infatuation to a woman--Ravan’s falling for Sita and ultimately meeting his sorry end. In the nights they read about the Lord Krishna who is affectionately called the head of the thieves as he used to steal butter and milk and also the hearts of the Gopis. Chanakya says that the great men never waste their time and study these epics to derive lessons from them and mend their ways accordingly. They always are in the pursuit of knowledge.]<br />

Good Company दशनयानसं पशम यी कू मी च पि णी। िशशु पालायते िन यं तथा स जनसंगित: ।। 137 ।। Darshandhyansanspasheimartsyee Koormee Cha Pakshini. Shishu Paalaayate Nittyam Tathaa Sajjan Sangatih. Like fish, tortoise and bird rear up their infants by looking, caring and touching them respectively, so does good company with respect to human beings. साधु य ते िनवत ते पु तर् ा: िमत्रािण बां वा:। ये च तै : सह ग तार त मा सु कृतं कुलम! ।। 138 ।। Saadhubhyaste Nivartante Putrah Mitraani Baandhavah. Ye cha tain Saha Ganttaarstaddhramaattsukritam Kulam. Normally sons, friends and brothers have a tendency to take one away from the company of holymen and noble, scholarly persons. But still those who are able to maintain such contact bring piety in the family atmosphere. संसार कू ट वृ य े पफले म ू ृ तोपमे । सु भािषतं च सु वादु : संगित स जने जने ।। 139 ।। Sansaar Koot Vrishassya Duephale Hyumritopame.

This world, in the form of a tree, has two nectareous fruits : sweet speech and good company. साधूनां दशनं पु यं तीथभूता: िह साधव:। कालेन पफलते तीथ: स : साधु समागम: ।। 140 ।। Saadhoonaam Darshanam Punnyam Teerthabhoothaah Hi Saadhavah. Kaalen Phalate Teerthah Saddyah Saadhu Samaagamah. One earns great merit by meeting the holymen who are like the sacred places with the difference that their meeting gives immediate good result while the visit to sacred places gives it after some time. स सगते भवित िह साधु ता खलानां साधूनां न िह खलसंगते : खल वम्। आमोद कुसुमभवं भूदेव ध े मृ द ्र ध्ं न िहकुसुमािनक धरयि त ।। 141 ।। Satsangaterbhavati Hi Saadhutaa Khalaanaam Sadhunaan Nahi Kalsangeteh Khattvam.

Mrindagandham Nahi Kussumaani Dhaarayanti. A good company generates the noble elements in the nature of the wicked but a bad or wicked company does not generate wickedness in the noble person. It is only the soil, which accepts the fragrance of flowers and not the fragrance, which refuses to accept the odour of the soil. ग यते यिद मृ गे द्रमि दरे ल यते किरकपोलमौि तकम्। ज बु का रयगतं च प्रा यते व सपु छखरचमख डम् ।। 142 ।। Gammyate Yadi Mrigendramandire Labbhyate Krikapolmauktikam. Jambukaashrayagatam cha prappyate Vattsapuchakharcharmakhandam. If any one goes to the den of a lion, one might get the pearl of the elephant’s head. But a visit to the lair of a jackal would yield only the tail-piece of a calf or the bits of donkey’s skin. [Meaning that high company yields noble benefits and the poor association gives only inferior things.] आपदथ धनं र े छय च िकमापद:। कदािच चिलता ल मी संिचतोऽिप िवन यित ।। 143 ।। Aapadartham Dhanam Rakshechayashcha Kimaapadah.

Riches are by nature fickle and even the large, accumulated wealth can be destroyed in a trice. मूखा: यत्रा न पू य ते ध यं यत्रा सुसंिचतम्। दा प यो: कलहो नाि त तत्रा श्री वयमागता ।। 144 ।। Moorkhah Yatra Na Poojyante Dhaannyam Yatra Susanchitam.

Where the dunces are not honoured, where the eatables are available in abundance, where the husband and wife do not quarrel with each other – the Goddess Lakshmi (or good luck) comes in that house on her own. य याथ त यिमत्रािण य याथ त य बांधवा:। य याथ: स पुमां लोके य याथ: स च पि डत: ।। 145 ।। Yassyaarthsstrassyamittraani Yassyaarthasstasya Baandhavah. Yassyarthah Sa Puamaamlloke Yassyaarthah Sa cha panditah. He who has money has many friends, many relations and he is also deemed a great man and a scholar. [Chanakya’s this aphorism is in direct contradiction with his earlier saying in which he asserts that a great man is he who doesn’t care for money but for honour. May be he is trying to compare what ought to be with what is in the reality.]<br />

Like it is essential for the bound water to have a little flow for its purity, so it is necessary to donate the part of the earned wealth for its protection. िव ं दे िह गु णाि वते षु मितमानना यत्रा दे िह विचत् प्रा तं वािरितधे जलं नयुचां माधुययु तं सदा। जीवा: थावर जंगमा च सकला सजी य भूम डलं भूय: प य तदै व कोिटगु िणतं ग छ य भे िनिधम् ।। 147 ।। Vittam Dehi gunaaniviteshu Matimaannaannyatra Dehi Kvachit Praaptam Vaaritidherjalam Dhanyachaam Maadhuryayuktam Sadaa.

Give riches to the virtuous only, never to the undeserving, to those who lack good qualities. The clouds derive water from the seas and then making it sweet and then rain on the earth to make the beings of the earth survive. Then this water returns to the sea many million times more than the water the seas had given to the clouds. [Chanakya says that if one gives money to someone who is wise, intelligent and full of virtues, the receiver is able to multiply it many times over and this way not only the receiver but the whole society is benefited. Giving the analogy of the sea-water-cloudrain-sea cycle, he explains his point very cogently. If the seas give water to cloud (the virtuous, deserving receiver), it makes it sweet and then rains it over the earth to help all beings survive there. Then through rivers this rain water, multiplied million times over by the clouds, returns to the seas, and during the process keeping the earth lush and green and its beings rejuvenated. िकं तया िक् रयते ल या या वधूिरव केवला। या तु वे यै व सामा यपिथकैिरिप भु यते ।। 148 ।। Kimtayaa Kriyate Laxammyaa Yaa Vadhooriv Kevalaa. Yaa Tu Veshyaiv Saamaanmyapathikairapi Bhujjyate. What are the uses of the riches kept inside the house like the bride of an orthodox and traditional family? And those riches which like the prostitutes are enjoyed by all have no usefulness either. [The miser keeps his wealth secretly hidden in the vaults which serve no purpose of the society. And the riches with the fools are like the prostitute enjoyed by others, especially the low category people. In that case also the wealth is not well spent. This way, obliquely Chanakya says that riches should be spent in the welfare of the virtuous who help the society and they should neither be amassed in a miserly way nor spent extravagantly.] कुचै िलनं द तमलोपधिरणं ब्रिशनं िन ठु रभािषतं च। सूयोदये चा तिमते शयानं<br />

All the riches and prosperity shun those person including even Lord Vishnu if he is also one of those who wear dirty clothes; who have filthy teeth; who are glutton; who speak harsh language and who continue to sleep even after the sun rise. [Chanakya says that callous lazy persons never come in wealth. Even if they happen to receive wealth by chance, it won’t stay with them if they continue to be callous and lazy. To be rich and prosperous one must be active and clean.] अित लेशेन ये चाथा: धम याितक् रमे ण तु । शत् णां प्रािणपाते न ते ते थ: न भव तु मे ।। 150।। Atikleshen Ye Chaarthaah Dharmasyaati Kramentu. Shatroonaam Pranipaaten Te Hyaarthah Na Bhavantu Me. I don’t crave for such a wealth which is extorted by saddening someone, by irreligious and immoral means or by seeking shelter of the enemies. [In the mordem context this could be interpreted as an unwillingness to get such a wealth as may be received by immoral means, by torturing anyone or from the enemy of one’s faith or country, i.e. the blackmoney or the money received through the smuggling activities or through the treacherous deal with the enemies.] अपु तर् ा य गृ ह शूनयं िदश: शू या तवबा वा:। मूख य दयं शू यं सवशू यं दिरद्रता ।। 151 ।। Aputrasya Griha Shoonnyam Dishah Shoonnyaasttvabaandhavaah. Moorkhassya Hridayam Shoonnyam Sarvashoonmyam Daridrataa. A home is vacuous for the one who has lost his son (or who has no son); all the quarters of the world are vacuous for him who has lost a brother (or who has no brothers); for the fool his heart is vacuous (i.e., he has no plans, no occupation) but for the pauper everything is meaningless or vacuous. [Here the vacuousness should be deemed to be absence of any hope. Obviously, a home has no hope for the sonless person; for the brotherless person, there is no hope to get support from any quarter of the world; a fool devoid of any capability to plan for future is hopeless and for a man without any resource of any kind, the whole existence is barren of any hope.] वरं वनं याघ्रगजे द्रसे िवतं द् मालयं प वपफला बुसेवनं। तृ णेषु शया शतजीणव कलं न बु धुम ये धनहीन जीवनम् ।। 152 ।। Varam Vanam Vyaaghragajendra Sevitam Drumaalayam Pakkvaphalaambusevanam.

It is imprudent to stay in a jungle teeming with panthers and elephants; to dwell beneath the trees and survive by eating wild fruits and drinking (unchecked) water; to sleep on the bed made of wild straw and wear clothes made of the bark of the trees. But, if one is forced to dwell among his close relations as a pauper it is better to go and stay in the jungles under the conditions explained above rather than stay there. [Meaning that if a person is poor and moneyless; he had better stay in a jungle suffering the most wild conditions rather than stay as a pauper among his relations.] अनागत िवधता च प्र यु प नमित तथा। ावे तौ सुखमे वेते यद्भिव यो िवन यित ।। 153 ।। Anaagat vidhaataa Cha Prattutpannamatistathaa.

In contradistinction to this stage, he who remains inactive, waiting for the good days to come destroys his own life. [A far-sighted and intelligent person is able to tackle the troubles far more efficiently than that fatalist sluggard who eventually gets destroyed by his lack of foresight and inactivity.] मूख तु पिरहत य: प्र य ो द्िवपद: पशु :। िभनि वा यशूलेन अदृ ययं क टकं यथा ।। 154 ।। Moorkhastu Paribartavyah Prattyaksho Dvipadah Pashuh. Bhinattih Vaakyashoolen Adrishyayam Kantakam Yathaa. One should cease contact with the fools, regarding them as the biped animals, because they sting us by their senseless speech as though they are piercing an invisible thorn. [A man devoid of common intelligence is like a two-footed animal. He stings us by his speech. Though we can’t see the thorn, we feel its pinch caused by his incisive words.] मांसम यै : सुरापानैमखै छास्रविजतै :। पशु िभ: पु षाकरै क् रांताऽि त च मे िदनी ।। 155 ।। Maansmakshayaih Suraapaanaimarkhaishchaastravarjitaih. Pashubih Purishaakaarainkraantaasti Cha Medinee. A meat-eater, a wine-taker and a fool are animals in the human form. The earth is getting distressed by their weight. [Chanakya regards meat-eaters, (liquor) wine-takers and fools as animals, despite their human form. All the three category-people, do not apply their intelligence to discern what is good for them and what is harmful. It is only the power of discretion to distinguish between good and evil that makes a man out of his beastly inclinations. Hence the observation.] ह तौ दानविजतौ श् ितपु टौ सार वतद्रोिहणौ ने तर् ो साधु िवलोकरिहते पादौ न तीथ गतौ। अ यायािजतिद पूणमुदरं गवणं तु ंगं िशरौ रे रे ज बु क मु च-मु च सदसा नीचं सु िन ं वपु : ।। 156 ।। Hastau Daanvarjitau Shrutimputau Saaraswatdrohinau Netre Saadhuvilokrahite Paadau Na Teerth Gatau.<br />

O Jackal! Quit your this (useless) body forthwith !! [Chanakya says that deem that arrogant person to be not a man but jackal who gives no alms, hears no knowledgeable discourse, sees no Sadhu, goes to sacred place and fills his belly with food earned through immoral means. Such a man is verily a jackal and must quit his body immediately.] िवप्राि म नगरे महान् कथय क ताल द् माणां गण: को दाता रजको ददाित वसनं प्रातगृ ही वा िनिश। को द : पिव दारहरण सवऽिप द ा: जना: क मा जीवित हे सखे िवषकृिम याये न जीवा यहम् ।। 157 ।। Vippraasminnagre Mahan Kathaya Kasttal Drumaanaam Ganah Ko Datta Rajako Dadaati Vasanam Praatgrihittvaa Nishi.

He who steals others’ wealth and others’ woman. Then how do you survive in this town?” “Just like an insect in the gutter:” [Chanakya says in this dramatic style that the town where no wise, intelligent, noble or scholarly person dwell, where people may not be deft and efficient but expert in looting others and each vying with others in bad manners and roguery, should be considered just a pile of filth or a gutter and whose citizens just the herd of insects.] आहरिनद्रा भय मै थुनािन समािन चै तािन नृ णा पशूनाम्। ानो नराणामिधे ो िवशे षा ानेन हीना पशु िभ: समाना।। 158 ।। Aahaarninddraa Bhaya Maithanaani Samaani Chaitaani Nrinaam Pashunaam.

All beings, including human beings need food, sleep, sex as their natural requirement and all experience the common emotion of fear (of the unknown). But discretionary power alone rests with the humans. Hence the man who is devoid of discretion is just an animal. (Eating food when hungry, sleeping when exhausted, indulging in sexual intercourse and fearings. Discretion endows man with the capacity to distinguish between the good and the evil, between knowledge and ignorance, etc. Obviously the person who is lacking in discretion or who has no discretionary powers is verily a beast.) ये षां न िव ा न तपो, न दानव<br />

Those who have no education or knowledge, no determination, no charitable disposition, no manners, no virtuous qualities and no firm faith are just a dead load on this earth. They ate verily beasts in human form roaming about on the earth [i.e., a man should be educated with the capacity to undergo penance to achieve certain objectives; he ought to have a charitable disposition, good manners, virtuous qualities and firm faith in his religion or belief. If a man lacks these, he is just a biped animal.] धमाथकाममो े षु य यै कोऽिप न िव ते । ज म ज मािन म ये षु मरणं त य केवलम् ।। 160।। Dharmaarthakaamamoksheshu Yassyai Koapi Na Viddyate.

Deftly using the bols’ (the rhythmic sounds) of Mridang to convey his abhorence for such person, he conveys his meaning very onomatopoetically that “fie upon such man!” धमाथकाममो ाणां य यै कोऽिप न िव ते । अजागल तन ये व त य ज म िनरथकम् ।। 163।। Dharmaarthakaamamokhaanaam Yessyaikoapi Na Viddyate.

Those who lack these qualities are wasting their life.] न यातं पदमी वर य िवि व संसारिव छ ये वग ारकपाटपाटनपटु धमोिप नोपािजत:। नारीपीनपयोध्रयु गलं व ने िप नािलंिगतं मातु :केवलमे व यौवन छे दकुठारो वयम् ।। 165।। Na Dhyaatam Paadmeeshvarassya vidhivattsamsaarvichattye Svargadvaarakapaat Paatanpatuh Dharmoapi Nopaarjitaah.

Neither we devoted our concentration of the feet of Lord Almighty to get release from the mundane bonds, nor we accrued religious merit to ensure our niche in the heaven, nor even in dreams we ever passionately embraced the solid softness of a woman’s breasts. Thus, except of acting as an axe on our mother ’s youthful beauty, what else did we achieve in the world? [Chanakya explains in this quatrain symbolically the attainments of the three basic alms: Moksha, Dharma and Kaam, whose achievement automatically ensures Artha, the last of the attributes. Release from the mundane world means Moksha; accrual of the religious merit ensures the adherence to Dharma and the excitement to embrace the hard breasts of a woman symbolically represents Kaam: In short, the meaning of this quatrain is that one wastes one’s life without attaining fulfilment of any of the four attributes explained above. Also, the fact is that delievery of a child entails decay of the youth on the part of the mother, So, if one has not attained fulfilment in any of the four attributes, what else the purpose of<br />

one’s birth be except ruining one’s mother ’s beauty.]<br />

Between the wicked and the snake, the snake is less evil because it stings once while the wicked stings on every step. [Snake would sting rarely and once but the wicked would sting repeatedly and even most unobstrusively. Hence the wicked is more dangerous than even a snake.]<br />

Vrishchikasya Visham Puche Sarvaange Durjane Visham. The place of poison in a snake is the tooth, in a fly the head, in a scorpion the tail but the wicked has poison in his entire body. [Meaning that a wicked person is much more deadly than all the poisonous insects and reptiles put together. Hence we must guard against the wicked.]<br />

Fiery temper, bitter speech, poverty, rancour for one’s own relations, slavery of the lowly persons and association with the rogues – these are some of the sure signs of a hellis soul. [A wicked person is invariably very short tempered with bitter speech and rancour and jealousy for his own kith and kin. Moreover, he has very bad relations with his own people. He would gladly serve the low persons and would move in the company of the rogues. Such a man should be deemed to be an incarnation of some evil spirit.]<br />

Even if one washes the anus region a hundred times, it can’t be made a pious organ, [Chankya asserts by this sweeping statement that the evil can’t be made good no matter what means one adopts to achieve this aim. It is as good as trying to wash the anus region to turn it into a pious opening, which it can never be.] वयस: पिरणामे िह य: खल: खल एव स:। सु प वमिप माधुय नोपायती द्रवा णम् ।। 174 ।। Vayasah Parinaame Hiyahkhalah Khalah Evasah. Supakkvamapi Madhurya Nopaayateendravaarunam. Even till the fag end of his life the wicked continues to be wicked. The indravarun fruit (a very bitter fruit) cannot become sweet even when it is well-ripe. [Wickedness of one’s character has no effect of age. The wicked person will remain wicked even if he turns old like the bitter fruit of Indravarun, which doesn’t become sweet even when it is fully ripe.] द मानां सु तीव्रेण नीचा: परयशोि नना। अश ता त पदं ग तु ं ततो िन दा प्रकुवते ।। 175 ।। Dahyamaanaam Suteevrena Neechaah Paryashoagninaa. Ashaktaast attpadam Gautum Tato Nindaam Prakurvate. The wicked burns with the fire of jealousy seeing the prosperity of others. Since he cannot progress (due to his shortcomings), he starts deriding others. [He who is jealous at other ’s prosperity is basically an incompetent person. Knowing his shortcomings he realises that he can’t achieve what others have done. But, his wicked nature refuses to admit anyone’s superiority. So he starts finding faults and deriding others to mentally efface the element of their superiority, only to assert his parity. It is a known psychological truth which Chanakya had opined milleniums ago, but it is still very true.] ह ती ह तसहस्रे ण शहतहु ने वािजन:। श्रृिगरी दशह ते न दे श यागे न दुजन: ।। 176 ।। Hastee Hastasahastren Shathasten Vaajinah. Shringinee Dashahasten Deshttyaagen Durjanah. Keep the distance of one thousand hands between an elephant and yourself, one hundred hands between a horse and yourself, ten hands between the animals with horn and yourself and a full country between the wicked and yourself [Chanakya has used the measure of the hand’s length only to make objective a subjective assertion. In short, he tries to bring home his point that the wicked is far more dangerous than all the basts. Keeping “full country between yourself and the wicked” means that one shouldn’t stay in the land inhabited by the wicked.] खलानां क टकानां च द्िविवधै व प्रितिक् रया। उपनामुखभंगों वा दूरतै व िवसजनम् ।। 177 ।।<br />

Shringaalkhuhasten Khadaghasten Durjanah. An elephant is kept under control by a goad, the horse by hand, the animals with horns by hand or stick and the wicked by a sword (or any Such weapon). [The emphasis is again on being ruthless in our dealing with the wicked.] कृते प्रितकृितं कुयात् िहंसेन प्रितिहंसनम्। तत्रा दोषो न पतित दु टे दौ ट ं समाचरे त् ।। 179 ।। Krite Pratikritim Kurryaat Hinsen Pratihinsanam.

Vyasane Youjayechatrum Mitram Dharme Niyojet. Marry your daughter into a noble family, employ your son into studies, engage your friend in good deeds and involve your enemy in the evil practices. [Marrying the daughter off into a good family; providing best possible education to the son; engaging the friend in good deeds and hoodwinking your enemy to involve him in some evil practices constitute a ‘must’ job in Chanakya’s view. He is one of those few thinkers who didn’t mince words when he exhorted all to adopt evil means to overcome an evil if need be. There is nothing immoral, for example, if we take recourse to speaking lies to subdue a liar.] क: काल: कािन िमत्रािण को दे श: को ययागमो:। क याहं का च मे शि तिरत िच तयं मु हुमुहु: ।। 181।। Kah Kaalah Kaani Mitraani Kodeshah ko Vyayaagamoh. Kasyaaham Kaa Chame Shaktirit Chinttyam Muhurmuhuh. How are the times? Who is a friend? What type of land is this? What is the income and what is the expenditure? What am I and how much power I really possess?–all these questions one must keep asking oneself. [Before entering into any venture, we must assess our position minutely. Most of the<br />
<br />
failures are caused by assessing only our strengths and not our weaknesses. We must weigh the pros and cons fully before doing anything. Only then can we expect successful results.] दाि यं वजने दया परजने शाठ ं सदा दुजने प्रीित: साधुजने मय खलजने िव जने चाजवम्। शौय शत् जने मागु जने नारीजने धूतता:। इ थं ये पु षा कलासु कुशला ते वे व लोकि थित: ।। 182 ।। Daakshinnyam Svajane Dayaa Parjane Shaathyam Sadaa Durjane Preetih Saadhujane Smayay Khalijane Viddvajjane Charjjvam.

They who treat their own people with love; others with kindness; who are ruthless to the wicked; straight forward to the noble; indifferent to the fool; respectful to the scholars; who take on their enemey with bravery and pay obeisance to the Gurus; who are not infatuated to the woman–they are known as great men. [In this quatrain, Chanakya has very succinctly sums up the ideal behaviour of a man with his society. Quid pro quo is the basic idea behind this behaviour.]<br />

Allegiance यत्रोदक तत्रा वसि त हंसा तथै व शु कं पिर यजि त। न हंसतु ये न नरे ण भा यं पुन तयज त: पुनराश्रय त: ।। 183 ।। Yatrodakastatra Vasanti Hansaa Stathaiv Shuskam Parittyajanti. Na Hansatullyen Naren Bhaavyam Punastayaajantah Punaraashrayantah. The swans dwell in the pond full of water. The moment its water dries they desert it. But man shouldn’t be like them to relinquish a place and again return to it. [Through this quatrain Chanakya expresses his opinion on allegiance. He says that the swans are basically the opportunistic and selfish. They stay for their own comfort and leave the pond heartlessly, without thinking about the agony the poor pond might be suffering. A man should not be so selfish but should live with his benefactor through weal and woe.]<br />

Foremost Duty धम धनं च ध यं च गुरोवचनमौष म्। संगृहीतं च कत यम यथा न तु जीवित ।। 184 ।। Dharma Dhanam Cha Dhaannyamcha Gurorvachanmaushadham Sangraheetam Cha Kartavyamannyathaa Natu Jeevati. One must go on accumulating religious merit, money, eatables, the teachings of the Guru and<br />
<br />
(herbal) medicines or else one can’t survive. [Here eatables means all those edible things, which could be preserved. Medicines means all the herbal medicines roots, etc. During the period of Chanakya, these herbs were the only source to procure, or prepare medicines from. The more one had them, the more his chances of recovery from any illness. Rest of the ‘must’ things are self evident.] यज दुजनसंसग भज साधुसमागमम्। कु पु यमहोरात्रं मर िन यमिन यत: ।। 185 ।। Tyaj Durjan Sansarga Bhaj Saadhu Sammagamam. Kuru Punnyamahoraatram Smar Nittyamanittyatah. One must shun the company of the wicked and seek association of the noble; one must keep on doing good deeds without foregetting Lord Almighty even for a moment. अन तशा त्रां बहुला च िव ा अ पं द कालो बहुिव नता च। आसानभूतं तदुपासनीयं हसो यथा ीरिमवा बु पयात् ।। 186 ।। Anantashaastram Bahilaashcha Viddyaa Alpam Dakaalo Bhauvighnataa Cha. Aasabhootam Tadupaasneeyam Hanso Yathaa Ksheermivaambupaddhyaat. There are infinite scriptures, unlimited branches of knowledge but human life is very short with many hurdles in that short duration. Hence one should, like the swan who makes clear distinction between milk and water even if they be mixed and drinks pure milk, drive the useful essence of all learning and discard the rubbish. [Meaning that the sea of knowledge is very vast and life is short–so one should suck out the essence of all learning and cast aside the useless information by clearly sifting them through one’s discertion.] तद् भोजनं यद् द्िवज भु तशे षं त सौ दं यित्क्रयते परि मन्। सा प्र ता या न करोित पाप द भं िवना य: िक् रयते स धम: ।। 187 ।। Tadd Bhojanam Yadd Dvij Bhuktashesham Tattsauhridam Yattkriyate Parasmin. Saa Praagyataa Yaana Karoti Paap Dambham Vinaa Yaha Kriyate Sadharmah. Food is that which is left over by the brahmans after having it to their bellyful; love is consideration for others; wisdom is that which prevents one from committing sin and noble religious act (Dharma) is that doing which one doesn’t feel arrogance. [i.e. One must eat after feeding the brahmans. We all love our own kith and kin but real love is that when we feel for others. Wisdom is that which saves one from committing sin. And we must not have the feeling of arrogance when indulging in the acts of charity, for if one does any good thing for others with the sense of the ‘doer-<br />
<br />
ship’ one loses all merit, according to the ancient Indian thought. Chanakya has merely repeated the same thought.] गतं शोको न कत य भिव यं नै व िच तये त्। वतमानेन कालेन प्रवत ते िवच णा: ।। 188 ।। Gatam Shoko Na Kartavya Bhavishyam Naiv Chintayet. Vartamaanen Kaalen Pravartante Vishakshanaah. One should not grieve for the past and worry for the future. The wise care for the present and chart their life’s course accordingly. [Care for the present sets right not only the past but also the future. The wise don’t cry on the split milk nor worry for the future.] परोपकरणं ये षां जागित दये सताम्। न यि त िवपद ते षां स पद: यु पदे -पदे ।। 189 ।। Paropkarnam Yeshaan Jaagaarti Hridaye Sataam. Nashyanti Vipadasteshaam Sampadah Syu Pade-Pade. Those who have consideration for others have their problems getting solved or destroyed automatically and they receive (unseen) benefits at every step. [Those who act good for others receive their goodness in reciprocation, solving their own problems. Yudhisthar says that if you aim at other ’s benefit, your own selfish end would also be served in the process.] य मा च िप्रयिम छे त् त य ब् या सदा िप्रयम्। याधे मृ गवध्ं ग तु गीतं गायित सु वरम् ।। 190 ।। Yasmaacha Priyamichhet Tassya Broo Yaatsadaa Priyam. Vyaagho Mrigvadham Gantu Geetam Gaayati Suswaram. Speak sweet before someone you expect a favour from. When the fowler spots a deer he sings a mellifluous song before killing it. [This Shloka is full of practical modern sense also, for people have grown quite shrewd-perhaps by following this dictum! The fowler and hunter must cover up their intention so as not to appear blantantly selfish. Preparation of the ground, which must be conducive for the germination of the seed is a compulsory ‘fore-act’ before sowing the seed!] अ यास न िवनाशाय दूर था न पफलप्रदा। से यतां मयभागे न राजविगु ि त्राय: ।। 191 ।। Attyaasann Vinaashaaya Doorasthaa Na Phalapradaa.

So, we must chose the mean position, i.e. we shouldn’t be very far off from or very near to them. [Proximity with the king might give some occasional benefit but the situation would expose one to the royal wrath consequence might be disastrous. The same is true with fire, woman and the Guru.] एक एव पदाथ तु ित्रधा भवित वी ित।<br />

The same object–the body of a woman–may be viewed differently by three different persons. The lecher sees it as the source of sexual gratification, the Yogi as a filthy, foul smelling corpse and the dogs as luscious meat. Chanakya says that the viewed object creates different impressions in different observers according to their basic nature. It all depends on how one looks at it. The lecher, ever intent upon having his sexual lust gratified looks at a woman’s body, through dead with sexually starved eyes. The Yogi, ever searching for dead would look at it as an object helping him in consummating his worship and a dog, ever-hungry for meat, looks at it as a luscious food. Chanakya subtly hints that the value of the viewed object, like beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder.] मिणलु ठित पादाग्रे काच: िशरिस धायते । क् रय-िवक् रयवेलायां काच: काचो मिणणिण: ।। 193 ।। Manirlunthati Paadaagre Kaachah Shiriasi Dhaaryate Kraya-Vikrayavelaayaam Kaachah Kaacho Manirnanih. Notwithstanding the gems rolling at one’s feet and the mere glass-objects kept on the head (respectfully), when the hour of bargaining for them for the sale arrives, the glass would be considered just the glass and the gems the priceless object. [Chanakya says that the adverse circumstances might belittle one’s position but they can’t diminish one’s intrinsic worth. When the time of reckoning arrives the glass-piece; however well kept won’t match with the gem. The external conditions only marginally affect the intrinsic worth of any object. Dust might cover the gem to render it lustreless but sooner or later it must fetch its intrinsic value. Reality can’t be hoodwinked by any trick for long.] लोभ चे दगु णेन िकं िपशुनता य ि त िक पातकै: स यं य पसा च िकं शु िचमनो य ि त तीथन िकम्। सौज यं यिद िकं गु णै सुमिहमा य ि त िकं मडनै : सद्िव ा यिद िकं धनैरपयशो य ि त िक मृ युना ।। 194 ।। Lobhashchedagunen Kim Pishunataa Yaddyasti Ki Paatakaih Sattyam Yattpasaa Chakim Shuchimano Yaddyasti Teerthen Kim.

Why must a greedy fellow be concerned with other ’s vices; a backbiter with sin; a truthful man with the performance of penance and austerities; a guileless heart with a visit to the sacred places; a celebrity with the want of self-decoration; a well educated man with wealth and an ill famed person with death? The greedy person hardly cares for other vices. If he can hope to usurp something from a most notorious person, he would not hesitate in doing so. Since greed is going to blind his vision, he looks at nothing else but at the desired object he covets for. The greedy would not be concerned whether the other one is a traitor or a patriot; what weighs most in his mind is the wealth that he possesses. He would be accepting anything from the most vile source if that satisfies his greed.<br />
<br />
Similarly, the one finding fault with others is not concerned with his treading on the immoral or sinth path if it satisfies his urge. He would concoct stories, impute false motives to have his say. Backbiting tendency is a pathological ailment and the one who has this tendency won’t be deterred even by the fear of committing a sin. And he, who is honest and truthful, doesn’t need to indulge in self-torture, for all such selfinflictions are performed to purge all the vices from his mind. When he is already honest and truthful, it means he is clean and needs no such self-inflictions. One goes to the sacred places apparently to earn merit which is the exclusive preserve of a guileless heart. Why must anyone go to wash his linen when it is already clean. The visits to the sacred places are supposed to make one guileless. When one is already guileless, why must one go to the sacred places? One wears good clothes, ornaments and does all sort of make ups only to be the cynosure of all eyes. But if one is already a celebrity, the need for such self-embellishments doesn’t arise, for his celebrity status makes one automatically the cynosure of all eyes. His fame rivets all attention to his personality. In modern context, it can be said that why must Gandhiji be clad in three pieces suit to merit people’s attention? Even if be clad in rags, it is he who would be the cynosure of all eyes and not a well-clad movie superstar? The Indian thought avers that the real education is that which liberates: ( सा िव ा या िवमु तये ) says the Upanishad. And wealth plus all mundane considerations bind one to these transient fallacies. Obviously, both are contradictory to each other. Good education liberates and wealth hinds. So, why should a well-educated or a liberated soul crave for wealth and other material possessions. Lastly, an ill-reputed or ill-famed person leads an already condemned life. It is virtually death that he undergoes in the condemned state. Since he is already as good as dead, death brings in no change. So an ill-famed person is hardly concerned with death. राजा वे या यम चाि न: चौरा: बालकयाचका:। परदु :खं न जानि त अ टमोग्रामक टक: ।। 195 ।। Raajaa Veshyaa Yamashchaagnih Chauraah Baalakyaachakaah. Pardukham Najaananti Ashtamograamakantakah. The king, the prostitute, the death-god Yamaraj, fire, thief, beggar, child and the persons (of the village) who enjoy making others fight. These eight kinds of persons do not experience the trouble of others. [If the king starts feeling the troubles of his subjects individually, he cannot run his state. For an efficient administration what the king should be concerned with is the overall problem of the subjects or of the society and not with the individual subject. If he does so, he can’t implement any of his rules or laws because some of them are bound to trouble someone individually. The prostitute is obviously unconcerned with her customer ’s problems. Her only concern is to extrot as much money from him against the services she provides him avail at her brothel. She has to be impervious to her client’s personal problems to succeed in her profession. [Similarly] death-god, Yamaraj cannot be individually concerned with anyone’s problem. This is a mechanical system, wherein, the person should die the moment his age expires. Like Yamaraj fire is also impersonal all, whether a live or dead. A beggar is always so overawed by his problems of survival that he has no time to think for<br />
<br />
others. The thief has to be impersonal or else he would fail miserably. And the child is hardly conscious of the other ’s problem due to his limited understanding. The most damaging among the lot is that disturbing person who loves to make people fight with each other. He derives saddistic pleasure out of such fights. If he also starts appreciating other ’s problems he just can go ahead whatever he relishes most.] सु िस मौषधं धम गृ हिछद्रं च मै थुनम्। कुभु तं कुश् तं चै व मितमा न प्रकाशये त् ।। 196 ।। Sushiddhamaushadham Dharm Grihachiddram Chamaithunam Kubhuktam Kushrutam Chaiv Matimaann Prakashyet. The wise man must always keep his secret concerning the following informations: about the efficacious medicines, about his Dharma (faith), the short comings of his household, his sexual contact, the rotten food already consumed and the bad or evil things heard by them. [It is a age old belief that if one finds a particular medicine quite effective, I would lose its efficacy if told about it openly. One should never declared, about his duty or faith or make a propaganda of it. The essence of a faith or a religious duty lies in its faithful adherence and not in its publicity. For, in that case you open yourself to criticism from others which might result in your becoming sceptical about it. Chanakya’s this assertion indirect contradiction to the prevalent practice of the modren times. Now the people believe more in the publicity of their faith. No ‘Jagaran’ or ‘puja’ is deemed complete unless accompanied by blaring you speakers and droning chants of the Mantras. This militant adherence a one’s faith and the accompanying show of it provoke others and cause disharmony in the society. In this context, Chanakya’s this observation appears full of relevant veracity.] It is pure common sense to hide you or your household shortcomings. Their exposure would bring you much less accolades for your simplicity but too many damaging remarks. Similarly, only a fool would spill out the details of one’s sexual contacts, even with one’s legally wedded wife. These things are not to be told but cherished and enjoyed in privacy. If the rotten food is already consumed there is no sense in Advertising about it. Suppose one has taken the soup with a dead fly in it. Chances are that it might not cause any ill – effect but if one is told about it, then psychologically it might create some disturbance in the system of the listener. Moreover, if one has eaten anything which is prohibited by one’s religion or society, there is no sense in advertising about it. The last observation is very meaningful. Often we hear something wrong about some person or some event. It is prudent not to give currency to it by telling others about it, for this is how a rumour spreads. Moreover, if in the fit of rage one mouth palpably something wrong about some one, your passing it to others’ may cause unwanted controversy. It is better not only from the personal but social point of view also. Do digest it rather than disseminate it. तृ णं लघु तृ णा ल ू ं तूलादिप च चाचक:। वायुना िकं न जीतोऽसौ मामायं याचिय यित ।। 197 ।। Trinam Laghu Trinaattoolam Toolaadapi Cha Yaachakah Vaayunaa Kirmna Jeetoasau Maamyam Yaachyishyati.<br />

A straw is very light but cotton is even lighter than it and a suppliant (or a beggar) is lighter than even cotton. Then why doesn’t the wind fly it away? It is because the wind is apprehensive lest it should start going something from it also. [It is an oblique way of saying that begging is the meanest work. The satire and the punch of the saying are apparent.] उ यां कोऽिप महीधरो लधु तरो दो या धृ ती लीलया ते न वं िदिव भूतले च सततं गोवधनो गीयसे । वां त्रौलो यधरं वहािय कुचयोरप्रेण नो ग यते िकं वा केशव भाषणेन बहुना पु यं यशसा ल यते ।। 198 ।। Uttyaam Koapi Maheedharo Laghutaro Dommaryaam Dhritee Leelayaa Ten Tvam Divi Bhootale Cha Statam Govardhano Geeyase.

Only because you could lift a small hill known as Goverdhan by your hand, you are in the heaven and the earth. And while you support all the three realms yet I hold you on the point of my breasts but I come in no reckoning. No need of saying more, O Krishna! tell me does one come in fame by dint of one’s (past earned) merit? [Making a complaint to Lord Krishna in a poetic way, the Gopi says that the Lord is known as Goverdhan (lifter) (he who lifted the hill called Goverdhan) in the heaven and the earth only because the Lord could do so by his hand. While she holds the Lord, the supporter of the three realms (the heaven, the earth and the Patal lok or Nether world), on the tip of her breasts in the most affectionate and intimate way, yet no one praises here for her about this marveollous feat. Then she asks Lord Krishna whether one earns merit not by one’s present doing but by one’s already existing celebrity status? Chanakya says in this poetic manner that those in fame have their tiny achievements magnified but a common man’s great achievements are not even taken notice of this comparitive allegory used by Chanakya in expressing this pithy observation goes to prove the lingual command and the poetic conjecture of this great man otherwise renowned for his scheming manipulations.<br />

Even the wise suffer grief by preaching a dunce pupil, supporting a vile woman and associating themselves with the melancholic persons: [Instructing a dunce is a futile effort, for he has no capacity to assimilate whatever he is taught. Supporting a vile woman means creating a danger for the entire society: Association with the melancholic people is infectious as it would cause sadness in the person who even tries to console them. Of course, one may sympathise with them but association with them is imprudent.] दु टा भाया शठं िमत्रां भृ य चो रदायक:। ससप गृ हे वासो मृ युरेव न संशय: ।। 200 ।। Dushtaa Bhaarya Shatham Mitram Bhrittyshchottaradaayakah.

Indeed one’s wisdom fails at the onset of the evil days. [Chanakya expresses wonder that how Lord Ram could lie lured by that golden doe – for which Sita forced him to go and get it for herself, when no such doe was ever created, seen or heard about by anyone. Regrettably, he says that indeed the onset of evil days is heralded by the failure of one’s common sense or wisdom. This last phrase 'िवनाशकाले िवपरीत बु द्िध?' is one of the most quoted expressions even in the modren times.] ब नािन खलु सि त बहूिन प्रेमर जु कृतब धनम यत्। दा भोदिनपु णोऽिप षडं िध्र िनि क् रयो भवित पंकजकोशे ।। 202 ।। Bandhanaani Khalu Santi Bahooni Premarajjukritabandhanmannyat.

The black bee which penetrates through even wood gets inertly enclosed in the fold of the lotus flower. [This is again a very poetic observation of supreme order. Chanakya says that love mellows down the beloved as the black-bee,<br />
<br />
capable of penetrating through as hard the material as wood, lovingly allows itself to be enclosed in the soft fold of the lotus. Indeed the bond of love it unique!] वह तग्रिथंता माला वह तघृ टचंदनम्। वह तिलिखत तोत्रां शक् र यािप िश्रयं हरे त् ।। 203 ।। Svahastagranthitaa Maala Svahastaagtirishtachandanam.

[One should never wear a garland made by oneself and should never apply the sandal paste rubbed by oneself as doing so takes away the charm. Similarly, one should never sing the self¬-created hymn. This observation stresses the obvious. In other words, it expresses the same feeling that ‘self-praise is no recommendation’.] गु हास त य नो िव ा न दया मांसभोजन:। दु य लु य नो स यं न त्रौण य पिवत्राता ।। 204।। Grihaasaktassya No Viddyaa Na dayaa Maansabhojinah.

One who is attached to home does not get knowledge (education), meat-eaters are not merciful; greedy are not veridical and effeminates are not pure. [Those who do not wish to get out of their homes cannot hope to be wise because they restrict their life to the confines of home. It is believed that knowledge is exposure to life. If one doesn’t expose oneself, how he is likely to become wise? The variety of experience adds to one’s knowledge. Obviously, a homing pigeon-type of man cannot be learned and knowledgeable. It is generally believed that those who eat meat have a killer ’s urge which dries their sense of mercy. Similarly, a greedy man cannot view anything with impartiality. Naturally, he would not be truthful. An effeminate person lacks firmness and will. Such boneless persons are ready for any compromise. And a compromising person can accept compromise at any level, whether physical or mental. Purity, whether mental or physical is maintained by a firm adherence of certain principles. Here an effeminate man doesn’t literally mean a man behaving as a woman but someone with a very weak will.] कोऽथा प्रा य न गिव्रते िवषियण: क यापदो तंगता:। त्रीिभ: क य न खि डतं भु िव: मन: को नाम रा िप्रय: ।। क: काल य न गोचर वमगमत कोऽथीऽगतो गौरवम्। को वा दुजनदु गुणे षु पितत: े मेण यात: पिथ ।। 205 ।। Koarthannpraappya Na Garvito Vishyinah Kasyaapadoa stangataah Streebhih Kasya Na Khanditam Bhuvih Manah Konaam Raagyapriyah.

Who doesn’t grow arrogant by coming in riches? What could indulge in the sensual pleasures end one’s grief? Whose heart has not been broken by women? Who could win the king’s favour for ever? Who didn’t bear the evil glance of time? Which beggar could ever command regard? Who is that person who could return safely after being trapped in the wickedness of the vile? [These observations in the form of query stress the opposite like “who doesn’t grow arrogant. . .” means riches make the receiver go arrogant certainly. Chanakya shared the inbuilt prejudice against women commonly prevalent in the ancient times, and hence the observation whose heart has not been broken by women. The royal favours are proverbially fickle, no king could be favourable to anyone for long. The rest of the observations are self evident.] िनमंतर् ाणो सवा िवप्रा गावो नव तृ णे सवा। प यु साहयु ता भया अहं कृ ण रणो सव: ।। 206 ।। Nimantranottsava vippraa Gaavo Nav Trinottsavaah.

[The aphorism conveys, the same meaning as conveyed by the famous English proverb: ‘One in hand is better than two in the bush’. ] परो े कायह तारं प्र य े िप्रयवािदनम्। वजये ादृशं िमत्रां िवषकु भं पयोमुखम् ।। 215 ।। Parokshe Kaaryahantaaram Prattyakshe Priyavaadinam. Varjayettadrisham Mittram Vishkumbham Payomukham. Shun a friend speaking fair on the face but acting foul in the absence like the pitcher filled with venom but having milk at the opening. [It means shun contact with an insincere friend who does good only to hoodwink you, for such a friend is no friend at all.] नदीनां श त्रापाणीनां नखीनां श्रृंिगणां तथा। िव वासो नै व कत य: त्रीषु राजकुले षु च ।। 216 ।। Nadeenaam Shastrapaaneenaam Nakheenaam Shringinaam Tathaa. Vishwaaso Naiv Kartavyah Streeshu Rajuleshu Cha. Rivers, weapon-weilders (having weapon in their hands), animals (beasts) with horn and paws, women and the members of the royal family should never be taken for granted. [One should never a ttempt to cross the river without assessing its depth and width, its current strength, etc. Similarly, those having weapon in their hand should never be taken for granted, for even the slightest suggestion of the provocation is enough to make them use their weapon. He has no preparation to make, the weapon is already in his hand. The same is true with the animals with horn and paws-a little carelessness can make them damage you. Lastly, women and the royal personages are fickle by their nature; hence one can’t be sure about their behaviour. Those who take these for granted suffer the adverse consequences.] न िव वसे कुिमत्रो च िमत्रो चािप न िव वसे त।् कदािच कुिपतं िमत्रां सव गु ं प्रकाशये त् ।। 217 ।। Na Vishuaset Kumitre Cha Mitre Chaapina Vishvaset. Kadaachittkupitam Mitram Sarva Gurhyaim Prakshyet. Never trust even your good friend, let alone the vile one, in anger your friend can expose your secrets out of vengence. [Chanakya doesn’t advise fully trusting even your best friend. There are<br />
<br />
certain secrets in one’s life which should never be discussed with anyone, even with your best friend who might embarrass you by exposing them in a fit of rage.] अथनाश मन तापं गृ िह या चिरतािन च। नीचं वा यं चापमानं मितमानन प्रकाशये त ।। 218 ।। Arthanaash Manastaapapapam Grihnyaashcharitaani Cha. Neechamvaakyam Chaapamaanam Matimaann Prakaashyet. Prudence lies in not disclosing to anyone the following secret: loss of one’s wealth; some personal tragedy; suspicion on wife’s conduct; mean outpourings of a vile person and the personal ignominy. [This observation is actually the continuation of the earlier one. In this, Chanakya spells out the secrets that shouldn’t be disclosed to anyone, for their disclosure would adds to one’s distress or discomfiture without providing any relief whatsoever.] मनसा िचि ततं काय वचसा न प्रकाशये त्। म त्रेण र ये द ् गूढ ं काय चािप िनयोजनये त् ।। 219 ।। Manasaa Chintitam Kaaryam Vachsaa Na Prakaashyet. Mantren Rakshnyed goodham kaaryam Chaapi Niyojayet. One should never leak out one’s well-thought out intentions, determinations and they should be jealously guarded like some secret Mantra. The implementation of them should also be achieved without any fanfare and in total secrecy (to ensure their successful accomplishment.) [Immature exposure of one’s intention often brings failure in its trail. If one has deliberated well on doing some particular job, it is only the total secrecy which ensures one’s applying one’s full potential in implementing them successfully.] लालनाद् बहवो दोषा ताडनाद् बहवो गु णा:। त मा पु तर् ां च िश यं च ताडये नन तु लालये त ् ।। 220 ।। Laalanaad Bahavo Doshaastaadanaad Bahavo Gunaah. Tasmaatputtram Cha Shishyam Cha Tadayenn Tu Laalyet. Excessive affection breeds flaws and admonition good qualities. Hence one’s son and disciple need more of admonition and less of affection. [This stage obviously comes when the son or the disciple is a little grown up, i.e. when they are prone to a variety of distraction and deviation from their aim out of the curiousity unchecked by discertion. This stage comes after the child is out of infancy and about to enter the stage of adolescence: Constant admonition would make him keep his energies totally applies to his marked pursuit.] पादशे षं पीतशे षं सा यशे षं तथै व च। वानमूतर् ासमं तोयं पी वा चा द्रायणं चरे त् ।। 221 ।। Paadshesham Peetashesham Saandhyashesham Tathaiv Cha.

<br />
Sandhya Worship (worship conducted in the morning and evening, during the transitional phase of night to day and vice versa) should never be consumed as if is as abhorsome as the urine of dog. If one drinks it, one must perform the fast of Chandrayan. [The crux of the aphorism is that water one used should never be used purely from the hygienic point of view. In a hot and humid climate, even water gets polluted when used. Moreover, the aphorism is also guided by the abundance of water. This could not have been an observation of an Arabic thinker where in his country where water is the most precious commodity, but only of an ancient North Indian whose land had abundant water supply. Chandrayan Vrat means keeping fast the whole day and having food and water only after seeing the moon.] िप्रयोिवप्रवहर् े च द प यो: वािमभृ ययो:। अ तरे ण न ग त यं हल य वृ षभ य च ।। 222 ।। Vipprayorvippravhaneshcha Dampattyoh Swamibhrittyoyh.

Never pass through between the two brahmans; between fire and a brahman; between the master and the servant; between the husband and wife; and between the plough and the bullocks. पादा यां न पृशद ं ि नं गु ं ब्रा णमे व च। नै व गावं कुमारीं चन न वृ ं न िशशु ं तथा ।। 223 ।। Paadaabhyam Na Sprashandagnint Gurum Brahmanmeva Cha. Naiv Gaavam Kumarim Cha Na Vriddham Na Shishum Tathaa. Never touch the fire, the guru, the brahman, the cow, the maiden girl, the old people and the kids. It is ill-mannerly to do so. उ प नप चा ाप य बु दि् धभवित यादृशी। तादृशी यिद पूव या क य या न महोदय: ।। 224 ।। Uttpannapashchaataapassya Buddhirbhavati Yaadrishee. Taadrishee Yadi Poorva Syaatkasya Syaanna Mahodayah. One repents after committing a mistake but if one gets such a wisdom before committing a mistake one’s progress cannot be stalled. [A wrong act entails repentance. One gets remorseful after knowing the fault he has committed. But if he could be wise enough before committing the act, there is no going back for him; for if one acts after carefully brooding on his course of action, there is no set back and hence the progress is unchecked and speedy.] यचे देकं कुल याथ ग्राम याथ कुलं यजे त्। ग्रामं जनपद याथ आ माथ पृ िथवीं यजत् ।। 225 ।। Tyajedekam Kulasyaarthe Graamassyaarthe Kulam Tyajet. Graamam Janapadasyaarthe Aattmaarthe Prithiveem Tyajat. Sacrifice a person for the sake of the family, a family for a village, a village for the state but for the self the entire world. [This oft-quoted shloka shows the degree of importance of an entity: of a<br />
<br />
person vis-a-vis a family; of a family vis-a-vis a village; of a village vis-a-vis a state; of the world vis-a-vis the self. In short the self protection is deemed paramount but here the self doesn’t mean only the selfish interest, it means the dictates of the inner conscience which ought to be held supreme.] आपदथ धनं र े द ् दारान र े द धनैरिप। आ मानं सततं र े द ् दारै रिप नैरिप ।। 226 ।। Aapadartham Dhanam Rakshed Daaraan RAkshed Dhanairapi. Aatmaanam Satatam Rakshd Daarairapi Dhanairapi. Protect riches (money) at the time of distress but protect wife (spouse) more than money and oneself more the riches and wife. [This Sholka again shows the degree of importance at the time of distress: self, spouse and riches in that order. Self is given the maximum importance because riches, wife and other ‘musts’ are useful only when one survives. Hence the importance.] जानीया प्रेषणे भृ यान् बा वान यसगनागमे । िमत्रं चापि काले षु भाया च िवभव ये ।। 227।। Jaaneeyaatpreshanebhrittyaan Baandhavaanvyasanaagame. Mitram Chaapiattikaaleshu Bhaaryaam Cha Vibhavakshaye. The servant is tested when he is sent on an important mission, the Kith and Kin are tested in one’s own distress, a friend at the hour of need or emergency and the wife when one loses one’s wealth. य य बु दि् धबलं त य िनबु े तु कुतो बलम्। वने िसंहो ममदो मत: शाशकेन िनपाितत: ।। 228 ।। Yasyabuddhirbalam Tassya Nirbuddhestu Kuto Balam. Vane Singho Mamadonmattah Shashaken Nipaatitah. He who has intelligence has power, for how can a fool has any power? A tiny rabbit is capable of slaying even a charged lion in the Jungle. [Intelligence scores over mere physical power. It is because of this mental shrewdness that a tiny rabbit is able to slay even a charged lion. This observation is derived from the old tale in which a tiny rabbit fools a mighty lion and manages to let the lion fall in a blind well and die. This tale is so symbolical that lion’s different forms is found in a score of ancient books of many countries.] ह ती थूलतनु : स चांकुशवशं: िकं हि तमात्रोंऽकुश: दीपे प्र विलते प्रण यित तम: िकं दीपमात्रं तम:। वज्रेणािभहता: पति त िगरय: िकं व्रज्रमात्रां नगा: ते जो य य िवराजते स बलवान थूलेषु क: प्र यय: ।। 229 ।। Hastee sthooltanuh sa Chankushuashah Kim Hastimaatronkushah Deepe Prajjvalite Pranashyati Tamah Kim Deepamaatram Tamah.

Does that make the goad as<br />
<br />
powerful as the elephant? A lamp when kindled removes darkness-does that makes the lamp equal to the darkness? The blows of a thunderbolt breaks a mountain into pieces.¬ Does that make the thunderbolt as big as a mountain? No. The brilliance has the power, physical massiveness does not matter. [Chanakya stresses the need of sharpness of the brain and intelligence against physical power. He says the brain always scores over brawn, which is a universal fact. Quoting various examples from nature, he proves his point quite poetically.] बलं िव ा च िवप्राणां रा : सै यं बलं तथा। बलं िव ं च वै यानां शूद ्राणां च किन ठता ।। 230 ।। Balam Viddyaacha Vipraanaam Raagyaah Sainnyam Balam Tathaa. Balam Vittam Cha Vaishyaanaam Shoodraanaam Cha Kanishthataa. The power of the brahmans is knowledge, of the king his army, of the trader-class their wealth and of the menial class their service ability. [Chanakya here stresses the truism first ennunciated by Manu.] बाहुवीय बलं राजा ब्रा णो ब्र िवतद् बली। पयौवनमाधुय त्रीणां बलमु मम ।। 231 ।। Baahveeryam Balam Raajaa Brahamno Bramhvid Balee. Roopyauvanmaadhuryam Streenaam Balmuttamam. The mighty-armed king is powerful; the power of the brahmans lies in their capacity to realise the Brahm {the ultimate}, beauty, youth and comeliness constitute the power of the ladies. [That king is deemed to be really powerful of the ladies. Who possesses the fount of his strength in his own self i.e., he doesn’t depend upon any other authority to weiled his power. The power, brilliance or ability of a brahman is judged by his capacity to realise the ultimate god, which means he must lead an austeric self-controlled and totally devoted life in the worship of God. The fount of a woman’s strength lies naturally in her beauteous form, youthful appearance and sweet, comely mannerism.] िछ<br />

If one goes to the jungle one beholds that the simple, straight trees have been cut but those which grow in a haphazard manner are spared. [A man should be simple hearted, straight mannered but not a simpletion. Or he is subject to the constant exposure of being granted and they suffer in the conequece out of their simplicity. Giving the example of trees, he says that mostly one is exploited for one’s generosity. If you are rude in behaviour and harsh in tongue; you, might be spreaded like those trees which grow in a wild manner.] अित पे ण वै सीता चाितगवण रावण:। अितदानाद् बिलब ो ित सवत्रा वजये त ् ।। 233 ।। Atiroopen Vai Seetaa Chaatigarvena Raavanah.

<br />
The excessive beauty caused Sita to be eloped, the excessive arrogance caused Ravan’s slaughter and excessive charitable disposition cause the king Bali to be duped. Hence excess is bad everywhere. [First two - references are quite well known. The king Bali was the famous demon king who was deceived by Lord Vishnu himself in the Vaman form. Chanakya says even the good qualities becomes bad in excess, let alone the bad ones. Excess of everything is bad.] उ ोगो नाि त दािरद्रयं जपतो नाि त पातकम्। मौनने कहो नाि त जाग्रत य च न भयम ।। 234 ।। Udyogo Naasti Daridaryan Japato Naasti Patakam. Maunane Kaho Naasti Jagratasya Cha Na Bhayam. Enterprise vanishes poverty and the chanting (of Mantra or God’s name) dissipates sin. Silence ends embroilment and awakening removes fear. उपसगऽ यचक् रे च दु िभ े च भयावहे । असाधुजनस पक पलायित स जीवित ।। 235 ।। Upasargeannyachakre Cha Durbhikshe Cha Bhayaavahe.

(Meaning that no one should stay at such places where riots, scuffles, severe drought or evil company be disturbing the area.) तावद् भये षु भे त यं यावद् भयमनागतम्। आगतं तु भयं वी य प्रहत यशंकया ।। 236 ।। Taavad Bhayeshu Bhetavyam Yaadav Bhayamanaagatam. Aagatam Tu Bhayam Veekshaya Prahartavyamshankayaa. One should be apprehensive of the cause of fear till it is far off, but when it comes close, fight it undaunted. [This is a natural human psychology that we apprehend the danger till it is far off. When it comes close the only way to deal, with it is to take on with total might, for in that stage the apprehension vanishes. Chanakya also confirms that this is the only way to overcome the fear.] अनुलोमे न बिलनं प्रितलोमे न दुजनम। आ मतु यबलं शत् ं िवनये न बलेन वा ।। 237 ।। Anulomen Balinam Pratilomen Durjanam. Aatmatullyambalam Shatrum Vinayen Balen Vaa. Deal with the powerful enemy by trying to win its favour (as a part of the strategy), with the wicked enemy by going away and with the enemy of matching power by being submissive or aggressive as the situation may demand. Direct opposition of the powerful enemy will cause sure defeat. In that case, it is always prudent to avoid direct confrontation. Trying to win favour means keeping him confused of your intention. If the enemy is wicked you never know what he might be upto. It is always better to avoid him and seize your opportunity to smash him in the least blows possible. It is only<br />
<br />
against an enemy of the matching power that one has to be aggressive or submissive according to the demand of the situtation.] वरं न राजा न कुराजराजा वरं न िमत्रां न कुिमत्रािमत्राम्। वरं न िश यो न कुिश यिश य: ।। 238 ।। Varam Na Raaja Na Kuraajaraajaa Varam Na Mitram Na Kumitramitram. Varam Na Shishyo Na Kushishyashishyah Varam Na Daaraa Na Kudaaradaaraah. It is better not to have a king than have a king who is tyrant; not to` have a friend than have a wicked friend; not to have a wife than have an unfaithful wife. [A tyrant king, a wicked friend, a bad disciple and an unfaithful wife should not be acceptable. It is better to go without them, as in such cases their absence ensures more peace and happiness than their presence.] कुराजरा ये न कुत: प्रजासुखं कुिमत्रािमत्रोण कुतोिभिनवृ ि :। कुदारदारै च कुतो गृ हे रित: कुिश यमयापयत: कुतो यश: ।। 239 ।। Kuraajraajjyen Kutah Prajaasakham Kumitramitren Kutoabhinivrittih. Kudaaradaaraishcha Kuto Grihe Ratih Kushishyamaddhyaaapayatah Kuto Yashah. How can the subjects be happy in the rule of a tyrant king? How can one get happiness in the company of a wicked friend? How can one enjoy domestic bliss with an unfaithful wife? And what renown can one earn by teaching a bad disciple. [This Shloka is almost the extention of the previous Shloka. In this, Chanakya specifies the situation resulting out of getting a tyrant king, a wicked friend, the unfaithful wife and a pad disciple.] गृ ही वा दि णां िवप्रा तयजि त यजमानकम्। प्रा तिव ा गु ं िश या द धर यं मृ गा तथा ।। 240 ।। Griheettvaa Dakshinaam Vippraasttyajanti Yajmanakam. Praaptaviddyaa Gurum Shishyaah Daggdhaarannyam Mrigaastathaa. The brahmans leave their host after getting the honorarium; the disciple leave their teacher after receiving education; the beasts leave the jungle when fire breaks out there. [This is a pithy yet melancholic observation. Chanakya says that driven by the matter of fact and selfish consideration all stay with anyone till they receive some material benefit. This is the golden rule of a materialistic world. A brahman stays with the host till he receives his honorarium. Similarly, students desert their teacher after getting education. Even the wild beasts, who feed on the luscious bounty of the jungle desert it when it comes to distress with the outbreak of the jungle fire. All are basically selfish.] िनधन पु षं वे या प्रजा भ नं नृ पं यजे त्।<br />

The prostitute deserts a poor customer, the subjects desert a powerless king. The same way the birds desert a fruitless tree and the guest deserts the host-house after having his food. [Continuing with the previous observation, Chanakya says that all stay till they receive benefits? then all desert–the prostitute, a poor customer, the subjects, a powerless king, the birds, a fruitless tree, and the guest, his host’s house, after filling his belly. All stay to serve their purpose without caring for the benefactor ’s need.] दृि टपूतं यसे त् पादं व त्रापूतं जल िपवे त्। शा त्रापूतं वदे द ् वा यं मन:पूतं समाचरे त् ।। 242 ।। Drishtipootam Nyaset Paadam Vastrapootam Jalam Pibet.

One should step forward after fully viewing the path, drink water after straining it through a (clean) cloth; talk in conformity with the scriptural dictates and act according to what one’s conscience allows. [These are ancient safety measures which are still quite relevant in their essential message.] वभावे न िह तु यि त दे वा: स पु षा िपता। ातय: नानपाना यां वा यदानेन पि डता: ।। 243 ।। Svabhaaven Hitushyanti Devaah Satpurushah Pitaa.

Daridasya Visham Goshthee Vriddhassya Tarunee Visham. Lack of practice makes the learning a poison; indigestion makes food a poison; conferences breed venom for the poor and a young woman is poisonous for an old man. [Any learning or expertise if not put to proper practice acts like poison. And even nectar can turn into poison if your digestion is weak because it is only after the food is digested that our body derives the required nourishment. Poverty is such a condition where no one wants to advertise or make others know about one acute indigence. Since the conferences exposes this condition to so many persons, they do breed venom for such a man. And lastly, young woman is a poison for an old man because in the old age the sexual appetite remains but due to the physical ennervation the performance become impossible. But on getting a young woman, the old persons would make their bodies overexert to achieve the desired performance. This over exertion may lead to death if not checked. Hence a young woman is poison for an old man.]<br />

A hermit is no authority on any subject; one who is not lecherous doesn’t need to decorate oneself; the scholars, seldom speak sweetly and the straight-forward, outspoken man is never a thug. [A hermit is a man who has renounced the world due to the aversion he felt for the material things. How can he, then, know about anything about the world? One decorates and gets make-up only to attract the opposite sex. When lacking in that urge, the desire to decorate oneself does not arise. The scholars are those who, due to their learning, see the reality much more clearly than others. And since reality is always bitter, how can they speak sweetly? Lastly, one who is not able to hide his true feeling can not hide his vile intentions also if he has them. But for thuggery or chicanery what needed is secrecy. Obviously, thuggery and outspokenness are not compatible.] नाि त मेघसमं तोयं नाि त चा मसमं बलम्। नाि त च ु समं ते जो नाि त चा नसमं िप्रयम् ।। 246 ।। Naasti Meghasamam Toyam Naasti Chaatsamam Balam.

[Since clouds carry the water to the most remote area and they bring water when most needed, they give us the best water–the best is what you need most at the most distressing situation. Self-strength is the most reliable power, hence best power. Every light is useless if one can’t see or if one has no eyes. Hence the eyes give us the best light. And no being can exist without food, hence food is the most desired object.] क य दोष: कुले नाि त याि ना को न पीिडत:। यसनं केन न प्रा तं क य सौ यं िनर तरम् ।। 247 ।। Kassya Doshah Kule Naasti Vyaadhinaa Ko Na Peeditah.

The king suffers the consequences of the sin committed by a nation (State), the king’s sins are suffered by his priest, the wife’s sins are suffered by the husband, and that of the disciple by the guru. [Since the king has the responsibility of running the State or the nation, naturally he can’t escape the<br />
<br />
consequence if someone has committed sins in his State. And the king is supposed to rule by the advice of his priest. So for king’s fault, the priest can’t escape blame. Similarly, the wife’s sins have to be suffered by the husband who is responsible for her, and similarly, of the disciple by the Guru.] ‘ यि मन् टे भयं नाि त तु टे नै व नागम:। िनग्रहोऽनु गर् हो नाि त स ट: िकं किरत यित ।। 249 ।। Yasmin Rushte Bhayam Naasti Tushte Naiv Dhanaagamah.

What is that which the drunkards do not babble and what is that which is not eaten by the crows? [Poets in their imagination can reach everywhere hence nothing is left unseen by them. Figuratively, women are capable of doing the most babble and the meanest deed possible, hence no holds are barred for them. A drunkard can mouth the filthiest abuse and for them also there is no limit on the either side. Similarly, the crows do not make any distinction in their choice of food and can devour even the dirtiest object.] नै व प यित ज मानध: कामा धे नै व प यित। मदो म ा न प यि त अथी दोषं न प यित ।। 251 ।। Naiv Pashyanti Janmandhah Kaamaandho Naiv Pashyanti.

This bee used to dwell among the lotus-petals and survived on imbibing the sap of the flowers. For some reason, it had to come to the foreign strand and now it regards a great gift to even the juice of the Kuruj flower, [When dwelling among the lotus-petals, the bee considered even the sap of the lotus to be an ordinary thing. But when, due to some reason, it has to go away to the foreign strands, it began to deem even the Kuruj-flower-sap to be a great gift, i.e., when someone belonging to a high and rich family falls on evil days, he realises the importance of the past pleasures and compromises with existing fallen standard of living. Helplessness makes one regard even the common place or even inferior things as the great gifts.] िनिवषे णाऽिप सपण कत या महती फणा। िवषम तु न वा य तु घाटाटोपो भयंकर: ।। 254 ।। Nirvishenaapi Sarpena Kartavyaa Mahatee Phanaa.

[Merely, by looking one can’t know whether the snake is poisonous or not but when it spreads its hood, this gesture is enough to frighten the people– meaning, for happy survival in a society, one must affect deterrant ostentation in one’s behaviour to keep unwanted people at bay.] यजे म दयाहीन िव ाहीनं गु ं यजे त।् यजे क् रो मुखी भाय िन: ने हा बा वां यजे त ् ।। 255 ।। Tyajedharam Dayaaheenam Viddyaaheenam Gurum Tyajet. Tyajettkrodhamukhi Bharyaam Nihshehaanbaandhavaansyajet. Give up the faith devoid of compassion; the Guru devoid of knowledge, an irascible wife and relations devoid of affection. [Faith, which is devoid of compassion is no faith; the Guru, who is devoid of knowledge is no guru; a wife devoid of good manners is no wife and the relations devoid of affection are no relations, hence they ought to be left for good.] नदीतीरे च ये वृ ा: परगृ हेषु कािमनी। मि त्राहीना च राजन: शीघ्रं न य यसंशयम् ।। 256 ।। Nadeeteere Chaaje Vrikshaah Pargriheshu Kaaminee. Mantreeheenaashcha Raajanah Sheeghram Nashyanttyasanshayam. The trees growing at the bank of the river, the woman staying in someone else’s house and the king denuded of the cabinet (ministers) perish soon. [The trees on the bank of a river are on infirmer land and face the danger of being taken away by flood waters. Also since the bodies are normally cremated on the bank of the rivers, the trees are likely to be cut for making the funeral pyre. Hence the trees on the river bank cannot last long. A woman staying in other ’s house cannot maintain her chastity and the<br />
<br />
firmness of her character for long and soon she will have to compromise. A king working without ministers does not get the right counsel and in this stage he is prone to committing a grave mistake causing his own downfall.] अनालो य ययं कता चानाथ: कलहिप्रय:। आत: त्रीसव े तर् ोषु नर: शीघ्रं िवन यित ।। 257 ।। Anaalochya Vyayam Kartaa Chaanaathah Kalahapriyah. Aartah Streesarvakshetreshu Narah Sheeghram vinashyati. A man, recklessly spend-thrift, shelterless, cantankerous, coveting for women of every caste indiscriminately soon perishes. [Obviously, such a man has no chance of faring in any different manner!] आल योपहता िव ा परह तं गतं नम्। अ पबीजहतं े तर् ां हतं सै यमनायकम् ।। 258 ।। Aalasyopahataa Viddyaa Parahastam Gatam Dhanam. Alpabeejahatam Kshetram Hatam Senyamanaayakam. Callous lethargy destroys knowledge; others hold on your money soon destroys it for you; the field is destroyed by the lack of seed and the army is destroyed in the absence of a commander. [A careless, lazy bloke cannot gain knowledge if he lacks in self-discipline which is a ‘must’ for becoming the learned. Money is with him who controls it. If others have control over it, deem it that it is lost for you. Lack of seed ruins the fertility of the field. It is a known fact that if you don’t sow a field for years together, it turns barren. And how can an army fight without a cammander?] दािरद्रयनाशनं दानं शीलं दु गितनाशनम्। अ ानतानािशनी प्र ा भावना भयनािशनी ।। 259 ।। Daariddrayahaashanam Daanam Sheelam Durgatinaashanam. Agyaantaanaashinee Praygyaa Bhaavaanaa Bhayanaashinee. Charity destroys poverty; right demeanour destroys distress; truth¬bearing wisdom destroys ignorance and the (determined) feeling destroys fear. [Poverty means lack of resources and charity means giving help to others, which obviously gives the impression that the person has enough¬ for one doles out elms only when one has enough of everything. And when people learn that you are gifting things, they develop confidence in your financial worth and you start getting things on credit. Thus, your stock increases and soon you get rid of that poverty. If one can maintain one’s balance, even in the severe distress, behave normally with total caution, the panic element in the distress vanishes. The same is true with other two observations. If one searches for the true knowledge, how can ignorance survive in one’s thinking. And lastly, the sense of fear is based totally on your mental projection of a situation. In the dark, a tree might give impression of a ghost but if you have strong will you may go near the tree and see it to be nothing but a tree. That stage you can achieve even by mere feeling. Fear is the projected perception of a given situation which is not dependent upon the external factors. In fact, all the four observations are rooted in the psychological aspect of the human behaviour.]<br />

That knowledge which is not used gets destroyed. Ignorance destroys the man. An army which has no commander gets destroyed and a woman without (the protection of) her husband gets destroyed. [Almost the similar thought was expressed in the earlier pages, which is duly explained. Please refer to that aphorism for the explanation.] अस तु टा द्िवजा न टा: स तु टा च महीभृ त:। सल जा गिणका न टािनल जा च कुलांगना: ।। 261।। Asantushtaa Dvijaa Nashtaah Santushtaashcha Maheebhratah. Salajjaa Ganikaa Nashtaanirjalajjashecha Kulaanganaah. An unsatisfied brahman and a satisfied king perish. A shy prostitute and a shameless bride of a noble family perish. [A brahman must not be covetous of the worldly possessions, if he does so, he can’t follow his chosen path of acquiring more and more knowledge. But if a king gets satisfied with his expeditions and victory marches, he exposes himself to invasion by others. A prostitute’s profession is such that if she is shy she will lose her clientele and her means of wherewithal. But in contradistinction, the bride of a noble family has to be shy and bashful to win everyone’s respect. A shameless bride is not deemed a respectable woman.] िनगु ण य हतं पं दु :शील य हतं कुलम्। अिस य हता िव ा अभोग य हतं धनम् ।। 262 ।। Nirgunasya Hatam roopam Duhasheelasya Hatam Kulam. Asiddhyassya Hataa Viddhyaa Abhogasya Hatam Dhanam. Beauty of the virtueless, lineage of the wicked, knowledge of the undeserving, and wealth of the unenjoyer perish. [Beauty without virtue is like body without soul–it is fey and can’t last long. Knowledge of the undeserving is the most deadly weapon for self-destruction. If a noble family has just one black-sheep, it is enough to bring blot on the entire family. Like a rotten apple injures all its companion, so a wicked member destroys his entire family. Wealth is meant to be enjoyed; those who preserve and protect it without enjoying it, lose it eventually.] अ नहीनो दहे द ्रा ट्रं म त्राहीन च ऋित्वज:। यजमान दांनहीनो नाि त य समो िरपु :।। ।। 263 ।। Annaheeno Dahedraashtram Mantraheenasheha Rittvijah. Yajmaan Daanheeno Nassti Yagyasamo Ripuh. A foodless state destroys its ruler, so do the brahmans assigned to perform yagya but without any knowledge of the Mantra and the host who doesn’t pay the honorarium to the guest brahmans. To employ such brahmans for performing the sacrifice and allowing such a person to play host is tentamount committing an act of treason. [Lack of food is the most potent cause for the dethronement<br />
<br />
of a ruler as it is the ruler ’s foremost duty to provide food or food material to the subjects: Asking the unlearned brahmans to perform yagya is to invite trouble due to their ignorance, instead of propitiating the deities they might incur their wrath. And the greatest offender to the moral sense is to accept the services without paying the adequate honorarium or remuneration. Even if the brahmans be unlearned, if the host has invited them unknowingly, then he must pay their due. One who does so is the meanest person. The state where the ruler fails to arrange adequate food supply to his subjects, the unlearned brahmans are asked to perform the yagya and if they are not paid their due honorarium is destined to be destroyed.] पर पर य मामिण ये भाष ते नराधमा:। ते एव िवलयं याि त व मीकोदरसपवत् ।। 264 ।। Parasparasya Marmaani Ye Bhaashante Naraadhamaah. Te Evavilayam Yaanti Vallameekodar Sarpvat. Those who disclose the mutual secret to others perish like a snake getting destroyed in its own cavity. [Disclosure of the mutual secrets to all not only incurs the displeasure of the confidant who let it out to one and who disclosed it but it makes one defenceless against the onslaughts of others, for which they quote one’s own words. This situation prepares a trap of self-strangulation like a snake getting chocked to death in its own cavity.] आ मवग पिर य य परवग समाश्रये त्। वयमे व लयं याित यथा रा यमधमत: ।। 265 ।। Aatmavargam Parittyajjya Parvargam Samaashret. Svyaamev Layam Yaati Yathaa Raajyamdharmatah. Those who leave their own category and seek support of the other category perish like a country resorting to immoral means. [One should’t forgo one’s own faith or way of leading life because change in it means resorting to some way about which you have no idea. It is ‘Adharm’ for the upholder of the forlorn faith. And while treading a new path one is likely to commit grave mistake, which may lead one to the way of doom. Chanakya avers Srimadbhagwat Gita’s dictate that one should never leave one’s way of working or in other words, one’s category or else one is doomed. आ त े षाद् भवे मृ यु : पर े षा सतु धन य:। राज े षाद् भवे ननाशे ब्र े षा कुल य: ।। 266 ।। Aaptdveshaat Bhavenmrittyuh Padveshaattu Dhanshayah. Raajdveshad Bhavennasho Brahmadveshaat Kulakshayah. Enmity with the noble-men and Sadhus (hermits) causes one’s death; with the adversary causes dissipation of wealth; with the king causes total ruin and with the brahman causes even cessation of one’s lineage. रा े धमिण धिम ठा: पापे पापा: समे समा:। राजानमनु वत ते यथा राजा तथा प्रजा: ।। 267 ।। Raagye Dharmani Dharmishthaah Paape Paapaah Same Samaah.<br />

Rajanamanuvartante Yathaa Raajaa tathaa Prajaa. Subjects follow their king: they are heathen if the king be irreligious; sinners if the king be a sinner and normal if their king be normal. As the king so the subjects. [The last phrase of this famous quotation is very well known. In the modern concept, it could be interpreted as the people follow their leaders. पु तकेषु च या िव ा परह ते षु च य नम्। उ प ने षु च कायषु न सा िव ा न त नम् ।। 268 ।। Pustakeshu Cha yaa Viddyahaa Parhasteshu Cha Yaddhanam. Uttpanneshu Cha Kaaryeshu Na Saa Viddyaa Na Taddhanam. The knowledge that remains confined to the books (and doesn’t get retained in the reader ’s mind) and the money that has gone in other ’s hand; neither there is any use of that knowledge nor there is any worth of that money. The inference is obvious. Knowledge must have its application to enhance its value like money must be in one’s control to be of any worth. िप्रयवा यप्रदानेन सव तु यि त मानवा:। त मात् तदे व व त यं वचने का दिरद्रता ।। 269 ।। Priyavaakyapradaanen Sarve Tushyanti Maanavaah. Tasmaat Tadev Vaktavyam Vachane Kaa Daridrataa. Sweet language satisfies all. Hence all must be sweet in their language. Even the excessive use of sweet words does not render anyone poor. कोिह भारत: समथानां िकं दूरं यवसाियनाम्। को िवदे श सु िव ानां को पर: िप्रयवािदनाम् ।। 270 ।। Kohi Bhaarah Samarthaanaam Kim dooram Vyavsaayinaam. Ko Videsh Suviddyaanaam Koparah Priyavaadinaam. Nothing is burdensome for a competent person. No place is far off for a trader, No land is a foreign strand for the scholar and no one is stranger for a man with a sweet tongue. [A competent person knows how to solve his problem so nothing is burdensome for him. For the trader no place is far off if he can get the right price for his merchandise. The learned man or the scholar, by dint of his learning, knows how to get settle in any land. And, how can anybody be stranger for the person who has a sweet tongue? Sweet speech makes even the most diehard enemy, one’s friend, let alone a stranger who bears no animus for anyone.] ताव मौने नीय ते कोिकल चै व वासरा:। याव सव जनान ददाियनी वाङ् न प्रवतते ।। 271।। Taavannmaunem Neeyante Kokilashchaiv Vaasaraah. Yaavatsarva Janaanandadaayinee Vaang Na Pravartate. The koel keeps quiet till she is able to coo in its sweet voice. And her this cooing delights everybody. [The koel coos up only during the spring. Otherwise, she keeps quiet. Then its cooing<br />
<br />
delights everybody’s heart. Chanakya impliedly says that we must keep quite till we are able to converse only in a sweet voice.]<br />

Anritam Dhyootakaarebhyah Streebhyah Shikshet Kaitavam. Learn courtesy from the princes, sweet speech from the learned scholars, lying from the gamblers and deceit from the women. [The princes are specially taught how to be courteous; how to carry themselves and how to behave, so they are the best source to learn about courtesy from; the learned knows where to use which word and with what effect to give more meaning to them. They are experts in conveying the most bitter meaning in the sweetest possible language. So, they are the best teacher to instruct in conversation. Owing to the demand of their profession the gamblers speak lies with such a flourish as to make them appear like the real truth: This art is to be learn from them. And, according to Chanakya, the women are past masters in the practice of deceit. They dupe so convincingly that many a wise man come a cropper against their hood winking expertise. So, the women are the best teacher in this field.]<br />
<br />
From the Lion प्रभूतं कायमिप वा त पर: प्रकतु िम छित। सवार भे ण त काय िसंहादे कं प्रच ते ।। 275 ।। Prabhootam Kaaryamapi Vaa Tattparah Prakartumichati. Sarvaarambhen Tattkaarya Singhaadekam Prachakshate.<br />
<br />
Whether it be big or small, we must do every work with our full capacity and power. We must learn this quality from the lion. [It is generally believed that the lion never does anything half heartedly. It would kill a rabbit or attack an elephant with its full ferocity. While acting this way we eliminate the possibility of suffering a set back out of the overconfidence of taking on our adversary.]<br />
<br />
From the Heron इि द्रयािण च संय य बकव पि डतो नर:। दे शकाल बलं ा वा सवकायािण सा ये त ् ।। 276 ।। Indrayaani Cha Sanyammya Bakavttyapandito Narah. Deshkaal Balam Gyaattvaa Sarvakaaryaani Saadhayet. Controlling all your senses like the heron, and after carefully considering the factors of time and space and the capacity of the self, the wise accomplish their work successfully. [The heron has this great capacity to forget everythingelse to concentrate on its target: So, this capacity of concentrating one’s mind on one’s aim or target should be adopted by us in our life. With this level of consideration and the proper assessment of one’s power vis-a-vis the time and place if the wise act, they are bound to succeed, for success depends upon the able assessment of one’s situation, the power of concentration and the capacity to put in one’s total might should the need arise.]<br />
<br />
From the Cock प्र यु थानं च यु ं च संिवभाग च ब धु षु। वयमाक् र यं भे तं च िशे च वािर कु कुटात् ।। 277 ।। Prattyuthaanam Chayuddham Cha Samvibhaayashcha Bandhushu. Svayamaakrabhya Bhoktam Cha Shikshechchattvari Kukkutaat. The cock can teach us four things : get up at the right time, fight bitterly, make your brothers flee and usurp and devour their share also. [Although apparently these appear quite immoral teachings in the present context also, what is taught here are the lessons in self-preservation against all odd, which is a natural instinct.]<br />
<br />
From the Crow गु ढ मै थुनकािर वं काले काले च संगर् हम्। अप्र वचनमिव वासं पंच िश े च वायसात् ।। 278 ।। Goodha mainthunkarittvam kale-kale cha sangraham. Appramattvachanam vishvassam panch Shiksheechcha Vaasyat. Stealthy copulation, collecting things and augmenting your resourcefulness from time to time; be alert and not beliveing anybody, making enough noise to make all gather round you–these five things are to be learnt from the crow. [This again is an instruction in the self-preservation. One marvels at the minute observation of Chanakya as a bird-watcher.]<br />
<br />
From the Dog बशी वलपस तु ट: सु िनद्रो लघुचेतन:। वािमीमा त च शूर च षडे ते वानतो गु णा: ।। 279 ।। Baahavshee Svalpasantushtah Sunidro Laguchetanaa. Swaamibhaktashcha Shoorashcha Shadete Shvaanato Gunaah. Deriving satisfaction out of a little eating even in the famished condition; be alert despite being deep in slumber, faithfulness and bravery–these six qualities ought to be learnt from the dog. [The dog has this unique capacity to derive satisfaction with whatever it manages to procure; for its eating despite its famished condition. It sleeps very soundly but, instantly wakes up hearing any sound. It is believed to be the most faithful animal. It is also a brave animal even against the fiercest odd. In saving its own or its master ’s life, its murderous streak is unmatched.]<br />
<br />
From the Donkey सुशर् ो तोिप वहे द ् भारं शीतो ण न प यित। स तु ट चरतो िन यं त्रीिण िश े च गदभात् ।। 280 ।। Sushraantoapi Vahed Bhaaram Sheetoshna Na Pashyanti. Santushtashcharato Nittyam Treeni Shikshechacha Gardabhaat. The capacity to carry the load despite being bone-tired, being undaunted by the vagaries of weather and getting satisfied in all the conditions–these three qualities are to be learnt from the donkey.<br />
<br />
How to control Whom लु मथन गृ ीया सत मंजिलकमणा। मूख छ दानुरोधे न यथाथवादे न पि डतम् ।। 281 ।। Lubhhdhamurthen Grihaveeyaattstabdhamanjalikarmanaa. Moorkashchandaanurodhen Yathaarthvaaden Panditam. Control greedy by money, the arrogant by submissiveness, the fool by preaching and the learned by telling him the reality. [First two observations are quite clear. The one dealing with the fool needs an elaboration. A fool is he who dosen’t know what knows. When he is preached, he realises his ignorance and this realisation makes him a little grateful to the preacher who can, then, mould him easily. Fourth : you just can’t fool an intelligent and learned man by mincing words or telling half truths to confuse him. His sharpness and intelligence would also expose the falsehood. So, it is always better if one tells the truth before such persons. Since, they are wise enough, they would realise the helplessness in the situation and accept whatever you ask them to. Straight forward talk is the best way to control or convince a Pundit or a learned and an intelligent man.]<br />

Miscellaneous कृ ज पि त राजान: सकृ ज पि त पि डता:। सकृ क या: प्रदीय ते त्री ये तािनक सकृ सकृत् ।। 282 ।। Sakrijjalpanti Raajanah Sakrijjalpanti Panditaah. Sakrittkannyaah Pradeeyante Treennyetaani Sakrittsakrit. The kings speak but once, so do the learned scholars. The daughter is gifted once. These three actions are performed just once. [The kings rarely repeat their order. Here ‘speak’ means to give orders. The voice of authority has to be listened with rapt attention, hence the utterance of the order only once is enough. The scholars give their observation, their opinion or their considered view point only once. Since, they speak after weighing all pros and cons, they speak less and do not repeat their; opinion or alter it. And gifting one’s daughter to a deserving groom takes place only once, which is still the practice prevalent in most of the traditional families in India.] एकािकना तपो ा यां पठनं गायनं ित्रिभ:। चतु िभगमन े तर् ां पचिभबहुिभ रणम् ।। 283 ।। Ekaakinaa Tapo Dvaabhyaam Pathanaam Gaayanam Tribhi.

For chanting of Mantras (worships) just one, for studies two, for singing three, at the time of going out (on foot) four, for working in the field five and many persons are required in the war. [Worship is obvious performed best when one is alone. In the studies one companion help, in exchanging the notes and discussing the problems for the better comprehension of the lesson. In singing, the requirement of three person is essential for the accompaniment’s sake. If one sings, the other gives accompaniment on the rhythm instrument (tabla,etc.) and the third person for the maintenance of the desired notes on the taanpuras: When going out on foot, four persons are needed to watch the four directions for any possible mishap. In the field, one is needed to water the plants, the other to clear the field of the unwanted growth, third to guard it against any unwanted intrusion, four to sow the seed and fifth to arrange the soil and look after the general maintenance of the field. Obviously, in war many persons are required to fight.] ज ममृ यु िनय ये को भुन ये क: शु भाशु भम्। नरकेषु पत ये क: एको याित परां गितम् ।। 284 ।। Janmamrittyurniyattyeko Bhunakkttyekha Shubhashubham. Narakeshu Patattyekah Eko Yaati Paraam Gatim. A man comes alone in the world, meets his end alone; alone he bears the consequences of his good or evil deeds, alone he suffers the tortures of the hell and alone he attains to the ultimate state. [Despite a man being dubbedas a social being in all major activities of his life, he is all alone. This way he shares nothing with any body. Chanakya reminds us this bitter truth that in this transient world nothing is permanent, neither any companionship nor any association.] लोकेन वा तद रे् न तदद्धद्ध रे ण वा।<br />

अव यं िदवसं कुयाद् दानायनकमिभ ।। 285 ।। Skloken Vaa Taddardhen Taddardhaaddardhaksharen Vaa. Avanndhyam Divasam Kuryaad Danaadhyan Karmabhi. One should always think over any Shloka or half or part of it or even a letter of it. This way brooding over (the pithy), ancient saying, studying and giving elms one should utilise one’s each day. [Brooding over, reflecting on and studying the scriptures and the other wise sayings one should pass his day. This way not only his intelligence would be sharpened and analytical power would also get improve but he would also be away from the various devastating distractions. Thus passing his free time in studying for the self-benefit and giving elms for the other ’s benefit, one utilizes one’s each day usefully.] श्<br />

Shruttva Dharman Vijaanaatishruttva Tyajati Durmatim. Shruttvaa Gyaanamvaapnoti Shruttvaa Mokshamavaapnnyaat. It is through hearing (the facts) that a man realises what is his real Dharma, and through hearing only that he gives up his ignorance (or stupidity). It is through hearing that he acquires knowledge and attain to the Moksha (final Liberation). [Man learns about his Dharma, gives up his evil mindedness (Durbudhi) and attains his final liberation only by listening to the wise teachings of his seniors, his Gurus, and other great persons. Chanakya says that these concepts cannot be attained by intuitive wisdom, but one learns about them from the external sources. Impliedly, he means that we all must listen to these wise teachings with rapt attention.] भ्रम स पू यते राजा भ्रम स पू यते द्िवज:। भ्रम स पू यते योगी त्री भ्रमती िवन यित ।। 287 ।। Bhramannsampoojyate Raajaa Bhramannsampoojyate Dvijah. Bhramannsampoojyate Yogi Stree Bhramati Vinashyatee. A roving king, a roving brahman and a roving Yogi are adored but a roving woman is doomed. [An efficient ruler is always on the move i.e. he is always gathering the first hand information to set his administration right. The subjects adore him for his ability to move about his State and solve their problems. A brahman lives in communion with eternity, hence he shouldn’t be attached to any particular place or person, for him the whole world is in the manifestation of the divine spirit. Practical interpretation of this aphorism would be that the more movement a brahman does, the more knowledge he acquires and hence he wins others adoration. The same is true with the Yogi. But if a woman keeps on moving, she exposes her to a variety of dangers, each being potent enough, in our society set-up, to bring her to disrepute, or the way to doom.] काल: पचित भूतािन काल: संहरते पजा:। काल:सु तेशु जागित कालो िह दुरितक् रम: ।। 288 ।। Kaalah Pachati Bhootaani Kaalah Sanharte Prajaah.

Time devours the beings and destroys the creation. It remains active even when the beings are asleep. No one can check its incessant flow. [Time is all powerful and ever active. Its ruthless counting continues even if we may be asleep or not conscious. No one can check its flow. All are helpless before time.] ग धं सु वण फलिम ु द डे नाकािरपु पं खलु च दन य। िव ान नीभूपितदीघजीवी धतु : पुरा कोऽिप न बु दि् धदोऽभूत ।। 289 ।। Gandham Suvarne Phalmikshudande Naakaaripushpam Kalu Chandanasya.

A scholar is never wealthy and a king is never long aged. Why did this presciences was not given to Brahma (the creator). [All good things are not perfect. The best metal gold satisfies all other senses but has no fragrance. Similarly, sugarcane, the best stem, is fruitless and the sandal, the best wood has no flower. Chanakya says, had the creator been advised earlier, he would have made these minor deficiencies correct in order to bring his creation perfect. Impliedly, it also means that nothing is perfect in the world.] िपता र नाकरो य य ल मीय य सहोदरी। शंखो िभ ाटनं कुया न द मु पिति ठित ।। 290 ।। Pitaa Rattnaakaro Yasya Laxamirasya Sahodari. Shakho Bhikshaatanam Kuryaann Dattamupatishthati. He whose father sea is the mine of the precious gems, whose real sister is the goddess (of wealth) Lakshmi, that conch-shell has to resort to begging. What could be more anomalous than this? [Conchshells are also produced by the sea. It is believed in the Hindu Mythology that the Goddesss Lakshmi originated from the sea. This way she is a sister to the conch-shell as both are produced by the same father sea. Sea is also supposed to be the place of origin of many a gem. The conch shells are otherwise worthless, barring their use in creating a peculiar sound: So building his full allegory, Chanakya opines with a touch of irony that even with such rich relations, the conch-shell has to survive begging.] सवौषधीनामममृ तं प्रधनं। सवषु सौ ये वशनं प्रधनम्। सवि द्रयाणां नयनं प्रधनं सवषु गात्रोषु िशर: प्रधनम् ।। 291 ।। Sarvausheedheenaamamritam Pradhaanam Sarveshu Saukhyaeshvashanam Praddaanam.

[Note: Normally Artha in Sanskrit means meaning or purpose but Chanakya’s view was the Artha meant gain of any kind and not only financial gain. That is why his famous treatise on the Statecraft is titled ‘Arthashastra’, for Chanakya believed that every activity of a state should be aimed to get benefit for the kingdom – be it social, financial and even spiritual. In this Sutra’s context also, spiritual gain is the root of all religious practices and gain of physical satisfaction is the root of all desires.] 91. अथमूलं कायम्। Money is the base of all the assignments. 92. यद पप्रय नात् कायिसद्िधभवित। With that gain (refer to the previous sutra) even with the less efforts one achieves one’s objective. 93. उपायपूव न दुस क ् रं यात्। If one has dedication to find a clue to solve a problem, no problem remains difficult.
